Here’s a detailed introduction you can use to talk for 10-15 minutes during an interview:

<hr></hr> "Good [morning/afternoon], my name is Ram Mohan Kotni, and I am a highly experienced Java Full Stack Developer with over 16 years of expertise in designing, developing, and optimizing scalable, high-performance applications. My career has been focused on delivering robust solutions that align with business goals, leveraging cutting-edge technologies and best practices.

I specialize in backend development using Java (8 and beyond), Spring Boot, and Microservices Architecture, as well as frontend development with Angular. My expertise extends to building RESTful APIs, implementing distributed systems, and ensuring seamless integration between services. For example, in my current role at Amazon Robotics, I designed and developed microservices for robot manufacturing and warehouse delivery, which improved system scalability by 40%. I also built dynamic dashboards using Angular, enabling real-time monitoring and enhancing user engagement.

In addition to my development skills, I have strong experience with cloud platforms like AWS and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). I’ve deployed applications using services like AWS Lambda, EC2, and GCP Kubernetes Engine, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance. For instance, I leveraged AWS CodePipeline and Jenkins to automate CI/CD pipelines, reducing deployment time by 60%.

I am also proficient in database management, working with both relational databases like Oracle and PostgreSQL and NoSQL databases like MongoDB. I’ve optimized database queries and implemented caching mechanisms like Redis to improve performance. For example, in a supply chain project at Biogen, I integrated multiple systems and optimized data processing, resulting in a 35% improvement in efficiency.

On the frontend, I have advanced expertise in Angular for building responsive, user-friendly interfaces. I focus on delivering seamless user experiences while ensuring scalability and performance. For example, I developed a real-time tracking dashboard for Biogen’s drug supply chain, which improved operational decision-making by 40%.

I am passionate about DevOps and automation, with hands-on experience in tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins. I’ve implemented CI/CD pipelines and containerized applications to streamline deployments and improve development velocity. For instance, at Dell Technologies, I led the migration of monolithic applications to microservices, reducing deployment time by 40%.

Security is another area I prioritize. I’ve implemented OAuth 2.0, JWT, and SSL/TLS encryption to secure applications and ensure compliance with standards like HIPAA and GDPR. For example, I designed secure systems for Biogen’s drug supply chain, ensuring 100% compliance with regulatory requirements.

Throughout my career, I’ve worked in Agile Scrum environments, collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver projects on time and with high quality. I’ve also mentored junior developers, fostering a culture of learning and collaboration.

In summary, my comprehensive experience in backend and frontend development, cloud technologies, DevOps, and database optimization positions me as a full-stack problem solver. I am passionate about adopting new technologies, solving complex challenges, and delivering innovative solutions that drive business success. I look forward to discussing how my skills and experience can contribute to your organization’s goals."

import { Component, signal, computed, effect } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-user',
  template: `
    <div>
      <h1>User Management</h1>
      <input [(ngModel)]="newUser" placeholder="Enter user name" />
      <button (click)="addUser()">Add User</button>
      <ul>
        <li *ngFor="let user of users()">{{ user }}</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Total Users: {{ totalUsers() }}</p>
    </div>
  `,
})
export class UserComponent {
  users = signal<string[]>([]); // Signal to hold the list of users
  newUser = '';
  totalUsers = computed(() => this.users().length); // Computed signal for total users

  constructor() {
    // Effect to log changes in the users signal
    effect(() => {
      console.log('Users updated:', this.users());
    });
  }

  addUser() {
    if (this.newUser.trim()) {
      this.users.update((currentUsers) => [...currentUsers, this.newUser]);
      this.newUser = '';
    }
  }
}

2. Explanation
Signal: users holds the list of users. It updates reactively.
Computed: totalUsers calculates the number of users based on the users signal.
Effect: Logs changes to the users signal whenever it updates.
3. Benefits of Signals
Simplifies state management.
Eliminates the need for manual subscriptions.
Improves performance by reducing unnecessary change detection.
This project demonstrates how Angular signals can be used to manage state reactively and efficiently.

To implement routing in an Angular application, follow these steps:


1. Set Up the Angular Router
Ensure the RouterModule is imported in your application module.

import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { HomeComponent } from './home/home.component';
import { AboutComponent } from './about/about.component';

const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: HomeComponent }, // Default route
  { path: 'about', component: AboutComponent }, // About route
  { path: '**', redirectTo: '' }, // Wildcard route for 404
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule],
})
export class AppRoutingModule {}

2. Add the Router Outlet
In your main template (e.g., app.component.html), add the <router-outlet> directive to display routed components.

<nav>
  <a routerLink="/">Home</a>
  <a routerLink="/about">About</a>
</nav>
<router-outlet></router-outlet>

3. Create Components
Generate components for each route using the Angular CLI.
ng generate component home
ng generate component about

4. Navigate Programmatically
Use the Router service to navigate programmatically.

import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { Router } from '@angular/router';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-navigation',
  template: `<button (click)="goToAbout()">Go to About</button>`,
})
export class NavigationComponent {
  constructor(private router: Router) {}

  goToAbout() {
    this.router.navigate(['/about']);
  }
}
5. Lazy Loading (Optional)
For large applications, implement lazy loading by creating feature modules.

const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'feature', loadChildren: () => import('./feature/feature.module').then(m => m.FeatureModule) },
];

This approach ensures efficient navigation and modularity in your Angular application.
