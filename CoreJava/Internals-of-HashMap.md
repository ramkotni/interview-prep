Internals of HashMap in Java
A HashMap in Java is a part of the java.util package and is a key-value pair data structure that allows you to store and retrieve elements efficiently. Under the hood, a HashMap uses a combination of hashing and buckets to achieve quick lookups and insertions. Here’s an explanation of how it works:

1. Hashing Mechanism
When you insert a key-value pair into a HashMap, it computes a hash code for the key using the hashCode() method.
The hash code is then processed (by applying a bit manipulation algorithm) to determine the bucket index where the key-value pair should be placed.
The HashMap uses an array of buckets (called an array of Node objects) to store the entries. The size of this array can be resized dynamically.
2. Bucket Array
The HashMap maintains an array of buckets, where each bucket is a linked list (or a balanced tree, introduced in Java 8 for improved performance in case of collisions).
The default initial capacity of a HashMap is 16, and the default load factor is 0.75 (meaning when the number of entries exceeds 75% of the capacity, the HashMap will resize).
The array is indexed by the hash of the key. Each index holds a linked list (or tree) of entries that have the same hash (more on collisions below).
3. Entry Object
Each key-value pair in a HashMap is stored in an Entry object, which has the following properties:

Key: The key of the key-value pair.
Value: The associated value for the given key.
Hash: The hash code of the key.
Next: A reference to the next entry in case of a hash collision (linked list or tree structure).
4. Resizing
When the number of elements in the HashMap exceeds the threshold (capacity × load factor), the HashMap will resize the internal bucket array, typically doubling the capacity.
Resizing involves recalculating the bucket index for each entry based on the new array size, which can be an expensive operation.
5. Operations
Put Operation: When a key-value pair is inserted, the key’s hash code is computed, and the appropriate bucket is located. If the bucket is empty, the pair is added directly. If the bucket already has entries (i.e., a collision occurs), a linked list or tree is used to store the new entry.

Get Operation: To retrieve a value for a given key, the hash code is computed for the key, the corresponding bucket is accessed, and the linked list or tree is traversed (if needed) to find the correct entry.

Collisions in HashMap
A collision occurs when two distinct keys have the same hash code (or their computed hash codes result in the same bucket index). In other words, multiple keys may be mapped to the same bucket due to their hash codes being identical (or causing the same bucket index after the hash is processed).

How Collisions are Handled in HashMap
Chaining: In the case of collisions, HashMap uses a technique called chaining. This involves creating a linked list (or tree) at each bucket where multiple keys hash to the same bucket. Each node in the list stores an Entry object.

Treeification (since Java 8): If the number of elements in a bucket exceeds a certain threshold (TREEIFY_THRESHOLD, typically 8), and the bucket is too long (i.e., a linked list of entries), the linked list is converted into a balanced tree (a Red-Black Tree). This improves lookup performance from O(n) to O(log n) in case of a large number of collisions.

Equality Check: When two keys hash to the same bucket, the HashMap needs to check if the keys are equal using the equals() method. If the keys are equal, the value is updated; otherwise, the new entry is added to the chain or tree.

Why Collisions Occur
Collisions can happen because the hash code is just an integer value, and multiple keys can potentially produce the same hash code. The quality of the hashCode() method of the key class plays a significant role in reducing collisions. A good hashCode() implementation tries to distribute keys evenly across the bucket array.

Here’s an example:

java
Copy
class MyKey {
    private String value;

    public MyKey(String value) {
        this.value = value;
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        // A poor hashCode example, which could lead to collisions
        return 1; // Always returns the same hash code
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (obj instanceof MyKey) {
            MyKey other = (MyKey) obj;
            return this.value.equals(other.value);
        }
        return false;
    }
}
In this case, all keys will have the same hash code, which would lead to collisions and potentially poor performance.

Impact of Collisions
Performance Degradation: If many keys map to the same bucket (or chain), it can degrade the performance of the HashMap from O(1) (ideal) to O(n) in the worst case (i.e., a long linked list).
Treeification: The conversion to a tree structure helps mitigate the performance hit for buckets with many collisions, but it's still not ideal.
Example of HashMap Collision
Let’s see an example where a collision happens in a HashMap:

java
Copy
import java.util.HashMap;

public class HashMapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HashMap<MyKey, String> map = new HashMap<>();

        MyKey key1 = new MyKey("A");
        MyKey key2 = new MyKey("B");

        map.put(key1, "Value A");
        map.put(key2, "Value B");

        System.out.println(map.get(key1)); // Outputs "Value A"
        System.out.println(map.get(key2)); // Outputs "Value B"
    }
}
In this case, if both MyKey("A") and MyKey("B") return the same hash code (say 1), both will be placed in the same bucket, and the HashMap will resolve the collision by chaining the entries.

Summary
Internals of HashMap: A HashMap uses an array of buckets and the hash code of keys to determine where to store key-value pairs. Collisions are handled by chaining (linked lists or trees) in the same bucket.
Collision: A collision occurs when two keys have the same hash code, causing them to map to the same bucket. It’s handled using chaining (linked list/tree) and requires key comparisons with the equals() method.
Impact of Collisions: Collisions can degrade performance if not handled efficiently, but the treeification of chains (since Java 8) helps improve lookup times when there are many collisions.
Good practices for using HashMap include implementing an effective hashCode() method and choosing keys that distribute well across the hash space to minimize collisions.

=============

HashMap Collision Explained with Example Data and Diagrams
In a HashMap, a collision occurs when two or more keys hash to the same index in the internal array (bucket) used to store the entries. The HashMap uses a hashing algorithm to calculate the index for each key, and if two keys produce the same hash value (or result in the same bucket after applying the hashing function), a collision happens.

Let's break this down with a simple example and diagrams.

Step-by-Step Example
1. HashMap Initialization
Imagine we have a HashMap with an initial capacity of 4 (just for illustration). The capacity determines how many buckets (or slots) the HashMap will have. In reality, HashMap starts with a capacity of 16, but for simplicity, we'll assume 4 buckets.

Buckets: [0, 1, 2, 3]
2. Inserting Key-Value Pairs
We'll insert two key-value pairs into the HashMap:

Key = "key1", Value = "value1"
Key = "key2", Value = "value2"
3. Calculating Hash Code
Java calculates a hash code for each key. Let's assume the hash codes for the keys "key1" and "key2" are as follows:

key1.hashCode() = 5
key2.hashCode() = 5
Notice that both keys have the same hash code (5). This means both keys will be mapped to the same bucket index after applying the hash code to the bucket array. In this case, the hash value modulo the number of buckets will be:

makefile
Copy
bucketIndex = hashCode % numberOfBuckets
For "key1": 5 % 4 = 1
For "key2": 5 % 4 = 1
So both "key1" and "key2" will be placed in bucket 1, leading to a collision.

Diagram of the Initial State
Before Collision
We have an empty HashMap with 4 buckets:

csharp
Copy
Buckets:
[0]  -> null
[1]  -> null
[2]  -> null
[3]  -> null
After Inserting "key1"
We calculate the bucket index for "key1":

key1.hashCode() = 5
Bucket index = 5 % 4 = 1
Now, "key1" will be placed in bucket 1:

csharp
Copy
Buckets:
[0]  -> null
[1]  -> ("key1", "value1")
[2]  -> null
[3]  -> null
After Inserting "key2"
Next, we calculate the bucket index for "key2":

key2.hashCode() = 5
Bucket index = 5 % 4 = 1
Now, we have a collision because both "key1" and "key2" hash to the same bucket (bucket 1). In this case, the HashMap will handle the collision by creating a linked list (or chain) at bucket 1 to store multiple entries.

csharp
Copy
Buckets:
[0]  -> null
[1]  -> ("key1", "value1") -> ("key2", "value2")
[2]  -> null
[3]  -> null
Here, bucket 1 contains two entries: one for "key1" and one for "key2". They are linked together in a list.

Handling Collisions: Chaining
In the case of a collision, HashMap uses chaining to store multiple entries in the same bucket. Each bucket can hold a linked list (or even a tree, in the case of many collisions, starting from Java 8) of Entry objects.

The linked list at bucket 1 after the collision looks like this:

rust
Copy
("key1", "value1") -> ("key2", "value2")
How Lookups Work with Collisions
To retrieve a value from the HashMap, the key's hash code is computed and the bucket index is calculated. In this case, for both "key1" and "key2", the hash code modulo the bucket array size will lead us to bucket 1. Once we are in bucket 1, we need to traverse the linked list to find the correct entry:

For "key1", the first entry in bucket 1 matches the key, so we return the value "value1".
For "key2", we traverse the linked list and find the second entry, so we return the value "value2".
Diagram of the Full Process
Let's summarize the entire process with a diagram:

1. Initial State:
csharp
Copy
Buckets:
[0]  -> null
[1]  -> null
[2]  -> null
[3]  -> null
2. After Inserting "key1", "value1":
csharp
Copy
Buckets:
[0]  -> null
[1]  -> ("key1", "value1")
[2]  -> null
[3]  -> null
3. After Inserting "key2", "value2" (Collision):
csharp
Copy
Buckets:
[0]  -> null
[1]  -> ("key1", "value1") -> ("key2", "value2")
[2]  -> null
[3]  -> null
4. Retrieving Values:
To retrieve "key1", we go to bucket 1 and find "key1", returning "value1".
To retrieve "key2", we go to bucket 1 and traverse the linked list to find "key2", returning "value2".
Collision Handling with Trees (Java 8+)
In Java 8 and beyond, if a bucket’s linked list exceeds a certain threshold (typically 8), the HashMap will convert the linked list into a balanced tree (Red-Black Tree). This is done to improve performance when there are too many collisions.

Treeified Collision Example
If there are too many entries in bucket 1, it might be converted to a tree:

csharp
Copy
Buckets:
[0]  -> null
[1]  -> Red-Black Tree ("key1", "value1") -> ("key2", "value2")
[2]  -> null
[3]  -> null
With this tree structure, lookup time in case of collisions improves from O(n) to O(log n), which is much faster for large numbers of collisions.

Summary
Collision occurs when two or more keys hash to the same bucket index in the HashMap.
Java handles collisions using chaining, where a linked list (or tree) is used to store multiple key-value pairs in the same bucket.
If the number of collisions in a bucket is large, Java 8 and later use a Red-Black Tree to improve performance.
By using these techniques, HashMap maintains an average time complexity of O(1) for most operations, even in the presence of collisions, while ensuring that key-value pairs can be retrieved efficiently.
