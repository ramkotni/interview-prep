Internals of HashMap in Java
A HashMap in Java is a part of the java.util package and is a key-value pair data structure that allows you to store and retrieve elements efficiently. Under the hood, a HashMap uses a combination of hashing and buckets to achieve quick lookups and insertions. Here’s an explanation of how it works:

1. Hashing Mechanism
When you insert a key-value pair into a HashMap, it computes a hash code for the key using the hashCode() method.
The hash code is then processed (by applying a bit manipulation algorithm) to determine the bucket index where the key-value pair should be placed.
The HashMap uses an array of buckets (called an array of Node objects) to store the entries. The size of this array can be resized dynamically.
2. Bucket Array
The HashMap maintains an array of buckets, where each bucket is a linked list (or a balanced tree, introduced in Java 8 for improved performance in case of collisions).
The default initial capacity of a HashMap is 16, and the default load factor is 0.75 (meaning when the number of entries exceeds 75% of the capacity, the HashMap will resize).
The array is indexed by the hash of the key. Each index holds a linked list (or tree) of entries that have the same hash (more on collisions below).
3. Entry Object
Each key-value pair in a HashMap is stored in an Entry object, which has the following properties:

Key: The key of the key-value pair.
Value: The associated value for the given key.
Hash: The hash code of the key.
Next: A reference to the next entry in case of a hash collision (linked list or tree structure).
4. Resizing
When the number of elements in the HashMap exceeds the threshold (capacity × load factor), the HashMap will resize the internal bucket array, typically doubling the capacity.
Resizing involves recalculating the bucket index for each entry based on the new array size, which can be an expensive operation.
5. Operations
Put Operation: When a key-value pair is inserted, the key’s hash code is computed, and the appropriate bucket is located. If the bucket is empty, the pair is added directly. If the bucket already has entries (i.e., a collision occurs), a linked list or tree is used to store the new entry.

Get Operation: To retrieve a value for a given key, the hash code is computed for the key, the corresponding bucket is accessed, and the linked list or tree is traversed (if needed) to find the correct entry.

Collisions in HashMap
A collision occurs when two distinct keys have the same hash code (or their computed hash codes result in the same bucket index). In other words, multiple keys may be mapped to the same bucket due to their hash codes being identical (or causing the same bucket index after the hash is processed).

How Collisions are Handled in HashMap
Chaining: In the case of collisions, HashMap uses a technique called chaining. This involves creating a linked list (or tree) at each bucket where multiple keys hash to the same bucket. Each node in the list stores an Entry object.

Treeification (since Java 8): If the number of elements in a bucket exceeds a certain threshold (TREEIFY_THRESHOLD, typically 8), and the bucket is too long (i.e., a linked list of entries), the linked list is converted into a balanced tree (a Red-Black Tree). This improves lookup performance from O(n) to O(log n) in case of a large number of collisions.

Equality Check: When two keys hash to the same bucket, the HashMap needs to check if the keys are equal using the equals() method. If the keys are equal, the value is updated; otherwise, the new entry is added to the chain or tree.

Why Collisions Occur
Collisions can happen because the hash code is just an integer value, and multiple keys can potentially produce the same hash code. The quality of the hashCode() method of the key class plays a significant role in reducing collisions. A good hashCode() implementation tries to distribute keys evenly across the bucket array.

Here’s an example:

java
Copy
class MyKey {
    private String value;

    public MyKey(String value) {
        this.value = value;
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        // A poor hashCode example, which could lead to collisions
        return 1; // Always returns the same hash code
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        if (obj instanceof MyKey) {
            MyKey other = (MyKey) obj;
            return this.value.equals(other.value);
        }
        return false;
    }
}
In this case, all keys will have the same hash code, which would lead to collisions and potentially poor performance.

Impact of Collisions
Performance Degradation: If many keys map to the same bucket (or chain), it can degrade the performance of the HashMap from O(1) (ideal) to O(n) in the worst case (i.e., a long linked list).
Treeification: The conversion to a tree structure helps mitigate the performance hit for buckets with many collisions, but it's still not ideal.
Example of HashMap Collision
Let’s see an example where a collision happens in a HashMap:

java
Copy
import java.util.HashMap;

public class HashMapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HashMap<MyKey, String> map = new HashMap<>();

        MyKey key1 = new MyKey("A");
        MyKey key2 = new MyKey("B");

        map.put(key1, "Value A");
        map.put(key2, "Value B");

        System.out.println(map.get(key1)); // Outputs "Value A"
        System.out.println(map.get(key2)); // Outputs "Value B"
    }
}
In this case, if both MyKey("A") and MyKey("B") return the same hash code (say 1), both will be placed in the same bucket, and the HashMap will resolve the collision by chaining the entries.

Summary
Internals of HashMap: A HashMap uses an array of buckets and the hash code of keys to determine where to store key-value pairs. Collisions are handled by chaining (linked lists or trees) in the same bucket.
Collision: A collision occurs when two keys have the same hash code, causing them to map to the same bucket. It’s handled using chaining (linked list/tree) and requires key comparisons with the equals() method.
Impact of Collisions: Collisions can degrade performance if not handled efficiently, but the treeification of chains (since Java 8) helps improve lookup times when there are many collisions.
Good practices for using HashMap include implementing an effective hashCode() method and choosing keys that distribute well across the hash space to minimize collisions.

=============

HashMap Collision Explained with Example Data and Diagrams
In a HashMap, a collision occurs when two or more keys hash to the same index in the internal array (bucket) used to store the entries. The HashMap uses a hashing algorithm to calculate the index for each key, and if two keys produce the same hash value (or result in the same bucket after applying the hashing function), a collision happens.

Let's break this down with a simple example and diagrams.

Step-by-Step Example
1. HashMap Initialization
Imagine we have a HashMap with an initial capacity of 4 (just for illustration). The capacity determines how many buckets (or slots) the HashMap will have. In reality, HashMap starts with a capacity of 16, but for simplicity, we'll assume 4 buckets.

Buckets: [0, 1, 2, 3]
2. Inserting Key-Value Pairs
We'll insert two key-value pairs into the HashMap:

Key = "key1", Value = "value1"
Key = "key2", Value = "value2"
3. Calculating Hash Code
Java calculates a hash code for each key. Let's assume the hash codes for the keys "key1" and "key2" are as follows:

key1.hashCode() = 5
key2.hashCode() = 5
Notice that both keys have the same hash code (5). This means both keys will be mapped to the same bucket index after applying the hash code to the bucket array. In this case, the hash value modulo the number of buckets will be:

makefile
Copy
bucketIndex = hashCode % numberOfBuckets
For "key1": 5 % 4 = 1
For "key2": 5 % 4 = 1
So both "key1" and "key2" will be placed in bucket 1, leading to a collision.

Diagram of the Initial State
Before Collision
We have an empty HashMap with 4 buckets:

csharp
Copy
Buckets:
[0]  -> null
[1]  -> null
[2]  -> null
[3]  -> null
After Inserting "key1"
We calculate the bucket index for "key1":

key1.hashCode() = 5
Bucket index = 5 % 4 = 1
Now, "key1" will be placed in bucket 1:

csharp
Copy
Buckets:
[0]  -> null
[1]  -> ("key1", "value1")
[2]  -> null
[3]  -> null
After Inserting "key2"
Next, we calculate the bucket index for "key2":

key2.hashCode() = 5
Bucket index = 5 % 4 = 1
Now, we have a collision because both "key1" and "key2" hash to the same bucket (bucket 1). In this case, the HashMap will handle the collision by creating a linked list (or chain) at bucket 1 to store multiple entries.

csharp
Copy
Buckets:
[0]  -> null
[1]  -> ("key1", "value1") -> ("key2", "value2")
[2]  -> null
[3]  -> null
Here, bucket 1 contains two entries: one for "key1" and one for "key2". They are linked together in a list.

Handling Collisions: Chaining
In the case of a collision, HashMap uses chaining to store multiple entries in the same bucket. Each bucket can hold a linked list (or even a tree, in the case of many collisions, starting from Java 8) of Entry objects.

The linked list at bucket 1 after the collision looks like this:

rust
Copy
("key1", "value1") -> ("key2", "value2")
How Lookups Work with Collisions
To retrieve a value from the HashMap, the key's hash code is computed and the bucket index is calculated. In this case, for both "key1" and "key2", the hash code modulo the bucket array size will lead us to bucket 1. Once we are in bucket 1, we need to traverse the linked list to find the correct entry:

For "key1", the first entry in bucket 1 matches the key, so we return the value "value1".
For "key2", we traverse the linked list and find the second entry, so we return the value "value2".
Diagram of the Full Process
Let's summarize the entire process with a diagram:

1. Initial State:
csharp
Copy
Buckets:
[0]  -> null
[1]  -> null
[2]  -> null
[3]  -> null
2. After Inserting "key1", "value1":
csharp
Copy
Buckets:
[0]  -> null
[1]  -> ("key1", "value1")
[2]  -> null
[3]  -> null
3. After Inserting "key2", "value2" (Collision):
csharp
Copy
Buckets:
[0]  -> null
[1]  -> ("key1", "value1") -> ("key2", "value2")
[2]  -> null
[3]  -> null
4. Retrieving Values:
To retrieve "key1", we go to bucket 1 and find "key1", returning "value1".
To retrieve "key2", we go to bucket 1 and traverse the linked list to find "key2", returning "value2".
Collision Handling with Trees (Java 8+)
In Java 8 and beyond, if a bucket’s linked list exceeds a certain threshold (typically 8), the HashMap will convert the linked list into a balanced tree (Red-Black Tree). This is done to improve performance when there are too many collisions.

Treeified Collision Example
If there are too many entries in bucket 1, it might be converted to a tree:

csharp
Copy
Buckets:
[0]  -> null
[1]  -> Red-Black Tree ("key1", "value1") -> ("key2", "value2")
[2]  -> null
[3]  -> null
With this tree structure, lookup time in case of collisions improves from O(n) to O(log n), which is much faster for large numbers of collisions.

Summary
Collision occurs when two or more keys hash to the same bucket index in the HashMap.
Java handles collisions using chaining, where a linked list (or tree) is used to store multiple key-value pairs in the same bucket.
If the number of collisions in a bucket is large, Java 8 and later use a Red-Black Tree to improve performance.
By using these techniques, HashMap maintains an average time complexity of O(1) for most operations, even in the presence of collisions, while ensuring that key-value pairs can be retrieved efficiently.



========

Internals of HashMap in Java
A HashMap in Java is an implementation of the Map interface and stores key-value pairs. Under the hood, it uses an array of buckets and a hashing mechanism to store and retrieve data efficiently.

Let's break down the internals of a HashMap, including how it works, how collisions are handled, and an example.

1. Hashing in HashMap
When you insert a key-value pair into a HashMap, the key is passed through a hash function to generate a hash code. This hash code is then used to determine the index in an internal array (called a bucket array) where the key-value pair will be stored.

Key steps involved:
HashCode Calculation: When you call put(K key, V value), the hashCode() method of the key is invoked to generate a hash code. The hash code is a 32-bit integer that represents the key.

Bucket Index Calculation: The hash code is then used to calculate the bucket index where the key-value pair should be stored. This is typically done by taking the hash code modulo the current size of the array.

java
Copy
int index = (n - 1) & hash;  // n is the number of buckets, hash is the hash code of the key
This step ensures that the hash code is distributed evenly across the buckets.

Storing the Key-Value Pair: The key-value pair is then stored in the bucket array at the calculated index.

2. The Structure of a HashMap
A HashMap uses an array to store its entries, and each entry is a linked list (or a red-black tree in Java 8 and above) when multiple keys hash to the same bucket. This is done to handle collisions (i.e., when two keys have the same bucket index).

Array of Buckets: The internal structure of a HashMap is an array of buckets, where each bucket stores a linked list of entries (key-value pairs).
Entry: Each entry in a bucket is represented by an Entry object, which contains:
Key: The key of the key-value pair.
Value: The value associated with the key.
Hash: The hash code of the key.
Next: A reference to the next entry in the linked list (used for chaining in case of collisions).
3. Collisions in HashMap
A collision occurs when two distinct keys generate the same hash code, and thus, they map to the same index in the bucket array. Since the HashMap uses the bucket index (calculated from the hash code) to store the key-value pairs, when two keys have the same hash code (or fall into the same bucket), they collide.

Why do collisions happen?
Hash Code Distribution: The hash code is a 32-bit integer, which means there are potentially many keys that can generate the same hash code, causing them to map to the same index.
Limited Bucket Size: The number of buckets in the HashMap is usually much smaller than the number of keys being stored. As a result, many keys may end up hashing to the same bucket index, leading to collisions.
4. How Collisions Are Handled
1. Chaining (Linked List)
The most common way HashMap handles collisions is through chaining, where each bucket holds a linked list (or a tree in some cases) of entries that have the same bucket index.

Linked List: When two keys hash to the same bucket, their key-value pairs are stored in a linked list at that bucket.
Performance: If there are a lot of collisions, the linked list can grow, and the performance of HashMap can degrade to O(n) for lookups, where n is the number of elements in the linked list.
2. Treeification (Java 8 and above)
In Java 8, if a bucket's linked list exceeds a certain threshold (usually 8 entries), the linked list is converted into a balanced red-black tree. This tree structure allows for O(log n) lookup, insert, and delete operations instead of the O(n) time complexity of a linked list.

When Treeification happens: If the number of elements in a bucket exceeds 8, the linked list is replaced with a red-black tree, which balances the entries and provides faster lookup.
5. Example of a HashMap in Action
Let’s walk through an example of how HashMap works, including a collision.

java
Copy
import java.util.HashMap;

public class HashMapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a HashMap
        HashMap<String, String> map = new HashMap<>();

        // Insert some key-value pairs
        map.put("A", "Apple");
        map.put("B", "Banana");
        map.put("C", "Cherry");
        map.put("A", "Avocado");  // Duplicate key, replaces "Apple" with "Avocado"

        // Print the HashMap
        System.out.println(map);  // Output: {A=Avocado, B=Banana, C=Cherry}
    }
}
Explanation:
The keys "A", "B", and "C" will be hashed into different buckets (since their hash codes will be different).
If there were a collision (e.g., if two keys had the same hash code), they would be stored in a linked list or tree at the same bucket index.
If we insert a duplicate key, like "A", the value will simply be replaced (no new entry is added).
6. Resizing of HashMap
As elements are added to a HashMap, the number of entries grows, and the map may eventually reach a point where the current bucket array is too small to handle the number of elements efficiently. At this point, the HashMap will resize:

Resizing: The capacity of the internal array is doubled, and all entries are rehashed and moved to new buckets based on their hash codes.
Threshold: The resizing happens when the load factor exceeds the threshold (usually 0.75). This means the HashMap will resize when the number of entries is 75% of the current capacity.
Use Cases of HashMap
Fast Lookups: HashMap is ideal when you need to store data in key-value pairs and retrieve values quickly based on the keys. Its average time complexity for get and put operations is O(1) (assuming a good hash function).

Caching: When building a caching system, HashMap can be used to store and retrieve cached data efficiently.

Counting Frequencies: You can use a HashMap to count the frequency of items. The keys would be the items, and the values would be the frequencies.

java
Copy
HashMap<String, Integer> wordCount = new HashMap<>();
wordCount.put("apple", 3);
wordCount.put("banana", 5);
Implementing Dictionaries: HashMap is commonly used to implement dictionaries, where words are the keys, and their definitions or translations are the values.

Why Collisions Happen in HashMap
Limited Hash Code Range: The hashCode() method generates a 32-bit integer, and since there are potentially many more objects than available hash codes, there is a chance that multiple objects will produce the same hash code.

Hashing Function Design: A poorly designed hashCode() method can increase the likelihood of collisions. For example, if many objects have similar hash codes (or if all objects have the same hash code), many keys will collide.

Load Factor: When the number of elements grows too large relative to the number of buckets (the load factor), the likelihood of collisions increases.

Conclusion
A HashMap in Java uses a hashing mechanism to store key-value pairs in an array of buckets.
Collisions happen when two keys hash to the same bucket index. These collisions are handled using chaining (linked lists or trees).
Treeification in Java 8 helps improve performance in case of large collisions by converting long linked lists into balanced trees.
Understanding hash code distribution and choosing an appropriate load factor can help reduce collisions and improve performance.

==============

o solve collisions in a HashMap in Java, we primarily rely on the mechanism called chaining. Chaining involves storing multiple key-value pairs at the same bucket in a linked list (or tree in Java 8+ if the list is too long). The solution to a collision does not require you to modify the HashMap itself, as it handles this internally.

However, for educational purposes, let's demonstrate how you can simulate solving collisions using a custom implementation, and then we'll look at how the HashMap itself resolves collisions automatically.

Understanding the Problem:
Collision happens when two different keys have the same hash code and thus get mapped to the same index in the HashMap's internal bucket array.
Java's built-in HashMap automatically handles collisions using chaining or treeification (if the linked list is long enough).
Approach to Solve Collisions:
In this example, we’ll implement a simplified version of a HashMap that handles collisions via chaining (linked lists). Here's how we can do it:

Hashing: Each key's hash code is used to determine the index in the array.
Chaining: If two keys hash to the same index, we store their key-value pairs in a linked list at that bucket.
Traversal: During lookup, we traverse the linked list at the bucket to find the corresponding key-value pair.
Custom HashMap Implementation for Collision Handling
Here is a Java program that demonstrates how collisions are handled manually using a linked list:

java
Copy
import java.util.LinkedList;

class CustomHashMap<K, V> {
    private static final int SIZE = 16;  // Number of buckets
    private LinkedList<Entry<K, V>>[] table;

    // Constructor
    public CustomHashMap() {
        table = new LinkedList[SIZE];
    }

    // Define the entry structure (key-value pair)
    static class Entry<K, V> {
        K key;
        V value;

        Entry(K key, V value) {
            this.key = key;
            this.value = value;
        }
    }

    // Hash function to calculate the index of the bucket
    private int getBucketIndex(K key) {
        return key.hashCode() % SIZE;
    }

    // Put method to insert key-value pair
    public void put(K key, V value) {
        int index = getBucketIndex(key);

        // If the bucket is empty, create a new LinkedList
        if (table[index] == null) {
            table[index] = new LinkedList<>();
        }

        // Check if the key already exists in the bucket
        for (Entry<K, V> entry : table[index]) {
            if (entry.key.equals(key)) {
                // If the key is found, update the value
                entry.value = value;
                return;
            }
        }

        // If the key is not found, add a new entry to the linked list
        table[index].add(new Entry<>(key, value));
    }

    // Get method to retrieve value by key
    public V get(K key) {
        int index = getBucketIndex(key);
        if (table[index] != null) {
            for (Entry<K, V> entry : table[index]) {
                if (entry.key.equals(key)) {
                    return entry.value;
                }
            }
        }
        return null;  // Return null if the key is not found
    }

    // Print the map for visualization
    public void printMap() {
        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
            if (table[i] != null) {
                System.out.print("Bucket " + i + ": ");
                for (Entry<K, V> entry : table[i]) {
                    System.out.print("[" + entry.key + "=" + entry.value + "] ");
                }
                System.out.println();
            }
        }
    }
}

public class CustomHashMapDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a new CustomHashMap
        CustomHashMap<String, String> map = new CustomHashMap<>();

        // Insert some key-value pairs
        map.put("A", "Apple");
        map.put("B", "Banana");
        map.put("C", "Cherry");
        map.put("A", "Avocado");  // Duplicate key, value will be updated

        // Display the map
        map.printMap();

        // Retrieve a value by key
        System.out.println("Value for key 'B': " + map.get("B"));
        System.out.println("Value for key 'A': " + map.get("A"));
    }
}
Explanation of the Program:
Bucket Array: We use an array of LinkedList to simulate buckets. Each bucket is represented by a linked list, where the key-value pairs are stored.

Hashing and Index Calculation: We use the hashCode() of the key to calculate the bucket index. The index is obtained by taking the modulus of the hash code and the number of buckets.

Handling Collisions:

If two keys hash to the same index, they will be stored in the same linked list at that bucket. The key-value pairs are chained together in the list.
When inserting a key-value pair, we check if the key already exists in the linked list. If it exists, we update the value; otherwise, we add a new entry.
Retrieving Values: To retrieve a value, we compute the bucket index and traverse the linked list at that bucket to find the matching key and return its value.

Example Output:
less
Copy
Bucket 5: [A=Avocado] 
Bucket 6: [B=Banana] 
Bucket 10: [C=Cherry] 
Value for key 'B': Banana
Value for key 'A': Avocado
How Collisions Are Handled:
For example, the key "A" and "B" may hash to the same bucket index (e.g., index 5). This means that both "A" and "B" will be stored in the same bucket. In this case, they are linked together as separate entries in the LinkedList at index 5.
When you insert the key "A" again with the value "Avocado", the program will check the linked list at index 5. Since "A" already exists, the value will be updated to "Avocado".
How to Improve this Example with Java's Built-in HashMap:
Java's HashMap already handles collisions in an optimized way, so you don't need to manually handle them. The HashMap class internally handles hashing, bucket indexing, collision resolution (using chaining or treeification), and resizing. Below is an example of how you can use the built-in HashMap to automatically handle collisions:

java
Copy
import java.util.HashMap;

public class HashMapDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a new HashMap
        HashMap<String, String> map = new HashMap<>();

        // Insert some key-value pairs
        map.put("A", "Apple");
        map.put("B", "Banana");
        map.put("C", "Cherry");
        map.put("A", "Avocado");  // Duplicate key, value will be updated

        // Display the map
        System.out.println(map);

        // Retrieve a value by key
        System.out.println("Value for key 'B': " + map.get("B"));
        System.out.println("Value for key 'A': " + map.get("A"));
    }
}
Summary:
Collisions in a HashMap happen when two or more keys hash to the same bucket.
Chaining is the technique used to resolve collisions, where each bucket holds a linked list of key-value pairs.
You can handle collisions manually by creating a custom HashMap (as shown above), but Java's built-in HashMap handles it for you efficiently.
The built-in HashMap may switch from a linked list to a red-black tree if there are many collisions, to optimize performance.
In real-world scenarios, using Java’s built-in HashMap is preferred, as it is highly optimized and handles resizing, hashing, and collision management automatically.
