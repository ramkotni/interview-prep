Hereâ€™s a comparison of the key features introduced in Java 8, Java 11, and Java 17 along with their release dates. The table below will also highlight the most notable updates for each version:


Key Features Explanation:
Java 8 introduced major updates like lambdas, the Streams API, Optional class, and new date-time API to bring functional programming features to the language.
Java 11 was an LTS (Long-Term Support) release, bringing improvements like a new HTTP client API, ZGC, and removal of some older features like Java Web Start.
Java 17 also an LTS release, introduced sealed classes, enhanced pattern matching, and continued improvements in garbage collection and performance.
These features show how Java evolved with each version, with Java 8 bringing functional programming features, Java 11 focusing on modernizing the Java platform and removing legacy parts, and Java 17 refining these features for modern application development with enhanced security and performance.
