[7:05 AM, 8/29/2025] Ram Kotni: Long Version (3–4 minutes)

“Thank you for giving me the opportunity to introduce myself.
I have over 16 years of experience in the IT industry, working as a Java Full Stack Developer across different roles such as Developer, Senior Developer, Technical Lead, and Application Architect.

On the backend side, I have strong expertise in Java, J2EE, and Spring Boot for building scalable microservices. I’ve worked extensively with databases like Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Cassandra, and I’ve also integrated caching layers such as Redis to improve performance. I have hands-on experience with messaging systems like Kafka and RabbitMQ for real-time event streaming.

On the frontend side, I have worked with Angular and React to build responsive and user-…
[7:06 AM, 8/29/2025] Ram Kotni: Great question 👍 — interviewers often ask “What’s your daily routine as a developer?” to understand how you work, collaborate, and manage your tasks.

Here’s a structured way you can explain your daily routine as a Java Full Stack Developer (with 16 years of experience). I’ll give you a generic template and then an example answer you can use in interviews.

🔹 Example Daily Routine Answer (2–3 mins)

“On a typical day as a Full Stack Developer, my day usually starts with a daily stand-up meeting where I sync with my team on what I completed yesterday, what I plan to do today, and if I have any blockers.

After that, I spend time reviewing my tasks from Jira (or any project management tool) and start working on the highest-priority items. This may involve backend development using Java, Spring Boot, and microservices, or frontend tasks in Angular/React, depending on the sprint goals. I also make sure to follow test-driven development (TDD), so I write unit tests alongside the code.

During the day, I collaborate closely with my teammates. I often do code reviews, provide feedback, and sometimes participate in design discussions for upcoming features. If there are integration challenges, I work with QA or DevOps to ensure smooth deployments using our CI/CD pipeline.

Since I also play a senior role, I spend part of my day mentoring junior developers, helping them debug issues, and guiding them on best practices like clean coding, design patterns, and 12-factor principles.

Toward the end of the day, I make sure my code is pushed, pipelines are green, and I update the task board with my progress. I also take a few minutes to plan for the next day or review upcoming user stories.

Apart from coding, I try to dedicate some time each week to learning new tools or frameworks, as continuous learning is important in this field.”

“My day starts with a stand-up meeting, followed by working on tasks from the sprint backlog. Most of my time is spent coding in Java/Spring Boot for backend or Angular/React for frontend, writing unit tests, and integrating with other services. I also do code reviews, collaborate with QA/DevOps, and mentor junior developers. At the end of the day, I push my changes, ensure CI/CD pipelines are successful, and update progress in the tracking tool.”
[7:09 AM, 8/29/2025] Ram Kotni: On a typical day as a Java Full Stack Developer, my work starts with a daily stand-up meeting where I update the team on my progress and discuss blockers. For example, at Amazon Robotics, we were working on real-time delivery agent tracking, so the stand-ups were critical to align backend, frontend, and DevOps teams.

After the stand-up, I check my assigned tasks in Jira or Rally and prioritize work. My day usually involves backend development using Java 17, Spring Boot, and microservices. For example, at Amazon Robotics, I designed microservices to process delivery data streams using Kafka and stored them in AWS S3 and Cassandra for real-time analytics. At Dell, I worked on enterprise-level applications using Spring, Hibernate, and Oracle DB.

On the frontend side, I’ve built responsive UIs in Angular and React — for example, at ERCOT, I worked on dashboards to monitor energy transactions, ensuring real-time updates and user-friendly interfaces.

Throughout the day, I collaborate with QA and DevOps. For example, in Biogen, I worked closely with DevOps to deploy applications on PCF and AWS using CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins and Docker. I also make sure my services are well-tested using JUnit, Postman, and integration tests.

Since I often play a senior role, part of my day goes into code reviews and mentoring junior developers, ensuring best practices like clean code, design patterns, and 12-factor methodology are followed. At Wells Fargo, I guided junior team members on building secure, scalable banking microservices.

At the end of the day, I push my changes to Git, ensure pipelines are green, and update Jira with my progress. I also spend some time preparing for the next day or reviewing upcoming requirements with the product team.

In short, my daily routine balances development, collaboration, mentoring, and continuous improvement, while making sure the applications we deliver are scalable, reliable, and aligned with business goals.”
[7:13 AM, 8/29/2025] Ram Kotni: Daily Routine with Agile Practices (Detailed – 2–3 mins)

“My daily work follows the Agile Scrum framework, so it revolves around both coding tasks and Agile ceremonies.
	•	Start of the Day: I begin with the daily stand-up meeting, where I share what I worked on yesterday, what I plan to work on today, and raise any blockers. For example, in my Amazon Robotics project, stand-ups were crucial because we were working on real-time microservices with dependencies across multiple teams.
	•	During the Sprint: After stand-up, I pick up tasks from Jira, aligned with our sprint goals. My work typically involves:
	•	Backend: Designing and developing microservices in Java 17 and Spring Boot, integrating with Kafka for event streaming and Cassandra/Redis for storage and caching.
	•	Frontend: Building Angular/React components, like I did in ERCOT for real-time energy dashboards.
	•	Testing: Writing JUnit/Mockito tests and using Postman to validate APIs. I follow TDD where possible.
	•	Collaboration: Reviewing code via GitLab/GitHub, pair programming if needed, and working with QA/DevOps for CI/CD deployments in AWS/PCF.
	•	Other Agile Ceremonies:
	•	Sprint Planning: I work with the product owner and team to size stories, clarify requirements, and commit to achievable sprint goals. For instance, at Wells Fargo, I was often involved in refining technical stories for microservices migration.
	•	Backlog Refinement: I contribute by breaking down epics into smaller user stories, estimating effort, and highlighting technical risks early.
	•	Sprint Review: At the end of each sprint, I demo the features I’ve developed, such as a real-time delivery tracking dashboard in Amazon Robotics.
	•	Retrospectives: I actively participate by sharing what went well (like smooth CI/CD releases) and what can be improved (like reducing environment downtime).
	•	Mentorship & Continuous Learning: Since I play a senior role, I also mentor junior developers, guide them on best practices like design patterns and clean coding, and keep myself updated with new tools and frameworks.
	•	End of the Day: I push code to Git, make sure pipelines are green, and update Jira with progress. I also take 10–15 minutes to plan for the next day or review upcoming backlog items.”

“My daily routine starts with a Scrum stand-up. Then I work on sprint tasks — coding backend microservices in Spring Boot/Java or frontend features in Angular/React, along with writing unit tests and doing code reviews. I collaborate with QA/DevOps on deployments and participate in other ceremonies like sprint planning, backlog refinement, reviews, and retrospectives. Since I play a senior role, I also mentor juniors and ensure best practices are followed.”
[7:18 AM, 8/29/2025] Ram Kotni: 1. E-Commerce Catalog
	•	SQL: Needs multiple normalized tables, joins to fetch product + reviews + inventory.
	•	MongoDB: One document per product with embedded reviews & inventory details → faster queries.
	•	Cassandra: Not ideal (catalogs change often, read patterns complex).

👉 Winner: MongoDB

⸻

2. Banking / Financial Transactions
	•	SQL: Perfect fit due to strong ACID guarantees.
	•	MongoDB: Supports ACID now, but not as proven as relational DBs in finance.
	•	Cassandra: Prioritizes availability → risk of inconsistent transactions.

👉 Winner: SQL

⸻

3. IoT / Sensor Data (High Volume, Real-Time)
	•	SQL: Struggles with billions of inserts per second.
	•	MongoDB: Handles semi-structured sensor data well, but might face scaling challenges under extreme write …
[7:25 AM, 8/29/2025] Ram Kotni: 1. ACID (Database Transactions)

Think of ACID like the rules of banking transactions — your money must be safe no matter what.
	•	A – Atomicity → “All or nothing.”
Like sending money: either the full transfer happens or nothing happens. No half transfers.
	•	C – Consistency → “Rules are always followed.”
Database always goes from one valid state to another. Example: If money is withdrawn from your account, it must be added to someone else’s account.
	•	I – Isolation → “Don’t disturb me while I’m working.”
Multiple transactions shouldn’t interfere with each other. Like if two people withdraw at the same time, balances remain correct.
	•	D – Durability → “Once done, always done.”
Once the transaction is committed, even a crash or power failure won’t erase it. Like once money is deposited, it stays there.

👉 Memory Trick: Think of ACID as a bank guarantee — money is Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, Durable.

⸻

🔹 2. 12-Factor App (Cloud-Native Principles)

This is like a recipe for cooking cloud apps so they scale, run anywhere, and are easy to maintain.
	1.	Codebase → One codebase, many deploys.
	2.	Dependencies → Explicitly declare them (no hidden packages).
	3.	Config → Store configs outside code (env variables).
	4.	Backing Services → Treat services like attached resources (DB, cache, etc.).
	5.	Build, Release, Run → Separate steps for reliability.
	6.	Processes → Run as stateless processes.
	7.	Port Binding → App exposes services via port (self-contained).
	8.	Concurrency → Scale by running multiple instances.
	9.	Disposability → Fast startup/shutdown for quick scaling.
	10.	Dev/Prod Parity → Keep environments as similar as possible.
	11.	Logs → Treat logs as event streams, not files.
	12.	Admin Processes → Run admin tasks as one-off processes.

👉 Memory Trick: 12-Factor = “CLOUD FRIENDLY” recipe: Config outside, Stateless, Scalable, Logs as streams, Fast deploys.

⸻

🔹 3. SOLID Principles (Object-Oriented Design)

Think of SOLID as rules to build strong houses (software) so they don’t collapse.
	•	S – Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
→ One class = One job.
Example: Don’t make a “Kitchen+Bathroom” room. Keep them separate.
	•	O – Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
→ Open for extension, closed for modification.
Example: Add a new TV without rebuilding the whole house.
	•	L – Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
→ Child class should work wherever parent is expected.
Example: If a bird is a parent, a sparrow (child) can fly, but a penguin shouldn’t break the rule.
	•	I – Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
→ Don’t force classes to implement things they don’t need.
Example: Don’t give a “Swim” interface to a Bird that only flies.
	•	D – Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
→ Depend on abstractions, not concrete classes.
Example: Instead of plugging your phone directly into the wall wiring, you use a socket (abstraction).

👉 Memory Trick: SOLID = “Strong Software Like Iron Door” → Single, Open/Closed, Liskov, Interface, Dependency.

⸻

✅ In short:
	•	ACID = Banking safety rules for transactions.
	•	12-Factor = Recipe for building cloud-native, scalable apps.
	•	SOLID = Guidelines to design strong, flexible, and maintainable code.
