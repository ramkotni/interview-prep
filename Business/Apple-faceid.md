Here’s an example of a product workflow for Apple, focusing on a feature like "Face ID Authentication". This example outlines the product requirements, workflow, non-functional requirements, implementation, and system design, along with roles and responsibilities.

1. Product Workflow Example: Face ID Authentication
Feature: Allow users to unlock their devices and authenticate securely using facial recognition.


Workflow Steps:
User Interaction:


The user sets up Face ID by scanning their face during the device setup process.
When unlocking the device or authenticating, the user looks at the screen, and Face ID verifies their identity.
Backend Processing:


The system captures the user's facial data and converts it into a mathematical representation.
The data is securely stored in the device's Secure Enclave.
During authentication, the system compares the live scan with the stored data.
Authentication:


If the match is successful, the user is granted access.
If the match fails, the user is prompted to use a fallback method (e.g., passcode).

2. Requirements of the Product
Functional Requirements:
Users can set up Face ID during device configuration.
The system can authenticate users using facial recognition.
A fallback authentication method (e.g., passcode) is available.
Face ID works for unlocking the device, app authentication, and payments.
Non-Functional Requirements:
Security: Facial data must be encrypted and stored securely in the Secure Enclave.
Performance: Authentication must complete within 1 second.
Reliability: The system must have a false acceptance rate (FAR) of less than 1 in 1,000,000.
Usability: Face ID must work in various lighting conditions and angles.
Scalability: The system must support millions of devices globally.

3. Implementation of Non-Functional Requirements
Security:
Use hardware-based encryption to store facial data in the Secure Enclave.
Ensure data never leaves the device or is shared with external systems.
Performance:
Optimize the facial recognition algorithm for speed and accuracy.
Use hardware acceleration for real-time processing.
Reliability:
Train the model with diverse datasets to minimize false positives and negatives.
Implement fallback mechanisms for failed authentication attempts.
Usability:
Use infrared sensors to enable functionality in low-light conditions.
Allow slight variations in facial appearance (e.g., glasses, beard).
Scalability:
Design the system to work independently on each device, reducing server dependency.

4. System Design
Components:
Face ID Sensor Module:
Captures the user's facial data using infrared and depth sensors.
Secure Enclave:
A dedicated hardware module for securely storing and processing facial data.
Authentication Engine:
Compares live facial data with stored data and determines access.
Fallback Mechanism:
Provides alternative authentication methods (e.g., passcode).
System Design Diagram:
Input: Face ID Sensor Module → Processing: Secure Enclave → Output: Authentication Engine → Fallback: Passcode.
Who is Responsible?
System Design: The System Architect is responsible for designing the overall architecture, including hardware and software integration.
Implementation:
Hardware Team: Develops the Face ID sensor module and Secure Enclave.
Software Team: Implements the facial recognition algorithm and authentication engine.
Testing: The QA Team ensures the system meets functional and non-functional requirements.
Product Manager (PM): Aligns the feature with business goals and oversees the roadmap.
Business Analyst (BA): Documents requirements and ensures alignment with user needs.
<hr></hr> This example demonstrates how Apple’s Face ID feature is conceptualized, developed, and delivered, with clear roles and responsibilities for each team member.
