Q1: What is Helidon SE?
A1: Helidon SE is a cloud-native, open-source set of Java libraries designed for writing microservices. It is powered by Java Virtual Threads and provides fast web code execution. It allows developers to create microservices without a CLI by using Maven. You can generate a Helidon SE project manually using Maven by running specific commands.

Q2: Can you describe your experience with microservices architecture?
A2: I have experience with microservices architecture, specifically with Spring Boot and AWS. In my recent project with Amazon Robotics, I developed a delivery services application using event-driven microservices architecture. The system used the Saga pattern, Kafka for event handling, and REST APIs to create a modular and scalable delivery solution. I worked on features like agent matching, route optimization, and real-time tracking.

Q3: How do microservices in Amazon Robotics’ delivery system operate?
A3: In Amazon Robotics, microservices operate in a modular, distributed manner. These microservices handle various processes such as assigning deliveries, managing routes, and tracking package statuses. They focus on tasks like order placement, inventory checks, and fulfillment. The system uses a delivery agent matching algorithm, which considers factors like location proximity, package priority, and workload to assign tasks efficiently.

Q4: How is route optimization handled in Amazon Robotics’ system?
A4: Route optimization is managed by a service that adjusts the delivery agent’s path based on factors like distance, traffic, weather, and priority orders. The system dynamically optimizes delivery routes, considering real-time data to ensure the most efficient path is selected for each delivery.

Q5: What is the Saga design pattern, and how is it used in event-driven microservices?
A5: The Saga design pattern is used to manage distributed transactions in microservices, particularly in event-driven architectures. It helps maintain data consistency across multiple services without a centralized transaction manager. In Amazon Robotics, Saga helps coordinate long-running workflows while avoiding issues like distributed deadlocks. There are two types of Saga patterns: choreography and orchestration.

Q6: What are the SOLID principles in software development?
A6: The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles used to create more maintainable and understandable software:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one job or responsibility.
Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
Q7: Can you explain some key features of Java 8?
A7: Java 8 introduced several key features:

Lambda Expressions: A way to provide the implementation of a functional interface, making code shorter and easier to read.
Stream API: A new abstraction for processing sequences of elements (like collections), supporting functional-style operations like map, filter, and reduce.
Default Methods: Methods that can be defined in interfaces, allowing for backward compatibility without affecting implementing classes.
Optional Class: A container object that may or may not contain a value, used to avoid null checks.
Date and Time API: New APIs for handling date and time, providing better accuracy and readability.
Q8: How are Java 8 streams classified?
A8: Java 8 streams are classified into two types of operations:

Intermediate Operations: These operations transform the stream into another stream (e.g., map, filter, reduce). They are lazy and do not produce an immediate result.
Terminal Operations: These operations produce a result or a side-effect (e.g., collect, forEach). Once a terminal operation is invoked, the stream is consumed, and no further operations can be performed on it.
Q9: What is the difference between the Runnable and Callable interfaces in Java?
A9: The Runnable interface is used for tasks that do not return a result, whereas the Callable interface can return a result and throw checked exceptions. Callable is often used with ExecutorService to submit tasks that need to return a value or throw exceptions.

Q10: What is Kafka, and how does the Consumer Group work?
A10: Kafka is a distributed messaging platform used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. A Consumer Group in Kafka allows multiple consumers to read messages from a Kafka topic in parallel. Each message is processed by only one consumer within the group, ensuring message processing scalability and fault tolerance.

Q11: What is the purpose of the "consumer group" in Kafka?
A11: A consumer group in Kafka allows multiple consumers to read messages from a topic in parallel. Each message in the topic is processed by only one consumer in the group, helping to achieve scalability and fault tolerance by balancing the workload across multiple consumers.

Q12: How do you ensure thread safety in Spring controllers?
A12: Spring controllers are by default singleton beans, meaning only one instance of the controller is shared across all requests. Since Spring ensures that each request is processed in isolation, the controller methods can be thread-safe, provided that the methods do not modify shared state.

Q13: Can you explain the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern?
A13: CQRS is a design pattern that separates read and write operations into different models. The write model handles commands (e.g., creating or updating data), and the read model handles queries (e.g., retrieving data). This pattern helps optimize performance, scalability, and security, particularly in systems where read and write operations have very different requirements.

Q14: How does Kafka help in real-time data processing?
A14: Kafka is used to publish and consume large volumes of data quickly and efficiently. It supports real-time data streaming and enables systems to handle high-throughput data pipelines. Kafka's distributed architecture and consumer group capabilities provide fault tolerance, scalability, and high availability.

Q15: What is the difference between Singleton and Prototype beans in Spring?
A15: A Singleton bean in Spring is created only once per application context, and the same instance is shared across all requests. A Prototype bean, on the other hand, is created every time it is requested, allowing for a fresh instance with each request.
