Here's a breakdown of the microservices used by companies like Amazon Robotics, Dell Technologies, and IBM, along with their architectures and associated patterns:

Amazon Robotics
Amazon Robotics leverages microservices extensively, using AWS services to deploy scalable, modular components for warehouse management. Key microservices handle tasks like inventory tracking, order processing, and robotic path optimization. These services are often hosted in Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) with AWS App Mesh for inter-service communication, allowing for seamless integration and easy scaling of each component. Patterns like the API Gateway are used to manage service endpoints, while event-driven patterns (e.g., AWS Step Functions) manage task automation in a decoupled, asynchronous way​

Dell Technologies
Dell’s microservices architecture is optimized for enterprise-scale applications, including customer support and supply chain management. They implement service discovery to manage the dynamic allocation of services within their infrastructure, commonly leveraging tools like Consul or Eureka for this purpose. They also use API gateways to streamline API management and CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) for systems requiring high-speed data access, ensuring data consistency across distributed services. CI/CD practices integrate tightly with microservices to accelerate deployment times.

IBM
IBM implements microservices across numerous domains, including healthcare, finance, and retail, using platforms like Red Hat OpenShift for containerized applications. Saga patterns are commonly used in transaction-heavy applications to ensure that distributed transactions maintain consistency without needing a centralized database. Additionally, IBM employs CQRS and event sourcing to manage complex workflows and provide robust historical data tracking, especially useful in financial applications that require precise auditing and tracking capabilities.

Microservices Patterns Overview
Saga Pattern: Used by companies with distributed transactions (e.g., IBM in financial applications) to manage complex transactions without locking resources.
Service Discovery: Essential for Amazon Robotics and Dell, enabling dynamic identification of services as they scale.
API Gateway: Commonly used by Amazon and IBM for managing external and internal API calls, ensuring consistent access control and load management.
CQRS: Applied by IBM and Dell for systems requiring separate query and command handling, improving data access speed and consistency.
Each company adapts these patterns to their specific needs, enabling flexibility, scalability, and the ability to handle high volumes of real-time data. These patterns and architectures support companies in scaling their operations effectively while maintaining system reliability and performance.
