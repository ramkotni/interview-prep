Question 1:
What is the strategic pattern, and how can it be applied in report generation?

Answer 1:
The strategic pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows the definition of a family of algorithms, in this case, report generation for different formats. This pattern enables making these algorithms interchangeable, which is helpful when each report format has a significantly different generation strategy. By using this pattern, you can separate the report generation logic into distinct strategies, making the system more flexible and maintainable.

Question 2:
What is the difference between a List and a Set in Java?

Answer 2:
A List maintains the insertion order and allows duplicates, while a Set does not maintain any specific order and does not allow duplicates. Performance-wise, a List allows faster access by index, and is commonly used when order matters. A Set, such as a HashSet, is optimized for faster search operations and is used when uniqueness is required. Examples of List include ArrayList and LinkedList, while examples of Set include HashSet.

Question 3:
What happens when you attempt to add a duplicate element to a Set in Java?

Answer 3:
When you attempt to add a duplicate element to a Set in Java, the element is simply not added. The add method will return false, indicating that the element was not added because it was a duplicate.

Question 4:
What is the difference between an ArrayList and a LinkedList in Java?

Answer 4:
An ArrayList uses a dynamic array to store elements, which makes it faster for accessing elements by index but slower for insertion and deletion because elements may need to be shifted. A LinkedList, on the other hand, uses a doubly linked list structure where each element is connected to the next and previous elements. It allows faster insertion and deletion, but accessing elements by index is slower as it requires traversing the list.

Question 5:
What are Java Generics and their main benefits?

Answer 5:
Java Generics were introduced in Java 1.5 and allow for parameterized types. Generics enable you to define types (such as Integer, String, or custom classes) in a more flexible and reusable way. The main benefits of using generics are:

They provide stronger type checking at compile time.
They eliminate the need for casting, reducing potential errors and improving code readability.
Generics help develop generic algorithms that can operate on various types.
Question 6:
What is an immutable object, and why is it useful?

Answer 6:
An immutable object is an object whose state cannot be changed after it is created. Strings in Java are a common example of immutable objects. Immutable objects are useful in situations where the state of an object should not be changed, especially in multithreading environments. They are also simpler to understand, offer better security, and help avoid issues with unintended changes in object state.

Question 7:
What is the difference between Comparable and Comparator interfaces in Java?

Answer 7:
The Comparable interface is used to define the natural ordering of objects within a class. The class implementing Comparable must override the compareTo method to compare objects.
The Comparator interface, on the other hand, is used for custom sorting. It allows defining multiple ways to sort objects without modifying the class itself. You can define sorting logic externally and apply it where needed.

For example, if you have a Book class, you could use Comparable to sort books by title, while Comparator could be used to sort them by author or price.

Question 8:
What is the difference between map and flatMap in Java Streams?

Answer 8:
The map method is used to transform each element of the stream into a new element, resulting in a stream of transformed elements. Each element is transformed independently.
The flatMap method is used when each element in the stream might produce multiple elements (e.g., when dealing with nested collections like a list of lists). It flattens the stream, combining multiple streams into a single continuous stream.

For example, if you have a list of lists and you want to transform them into a flat list, you would use flatMap to combine the elements from all the sub-lists into a single stream.

Question 9:
What are the three types of Dependency Injection in Spring?

Answer 9:
The three types of Dependency Injection in Spring are:

Constructor Injection: Dependencies are provided through the class constructor.
Setter Injection: Dependencies are provided through setter methods.
Field Injection: Dependencies are injected directly into the fields of a class using annotations like @Autowired.
Dependency Injection helps achieve loose coupling by injecting dependencies from the outside, making classes more flexible and testable.

Question 10:
Can you explain the concept of loose coupling and how Dependency Injection (DI) achieves it?

Answer 10:
Loose coupling refers to a design principle where components of a system are not tightly bound to each other. This allows for easier maintenance, testing, and flexibility in replacing components without affecting the entire system.

Dependency Injection achieves loose coupling by providing objects with their dependencies from the outside (instead of the objects creating the dependencies themselves). This makes the system more modular, as classes are not tightly coupled to the concrete implementations of their dependencies. For example, in an e-commerce application, a PaymentService class may depend on different payment methods like CreditCardPayment or PaypalPayment. Using DI, the PaymentService can receive the appropriate payment method implementation without directly creating instances of those classes.

Question 11:
Can you explain what SOLID principles are and how Dependency Injection relates to them?

Answer 11:
SOLID is an acronym for five design principles aimed at making software more understandable, flexible, and maintainable:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
Dependency Injection is related to these principles, especially the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP). DIP states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. By using DI, you can inject abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete implementations, which reduces tight coupling between modules and aligns with DIP.
