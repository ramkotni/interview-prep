C# (pronounced "C-sharp") is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft as part of the .NET framework. It is a statically-typed language that is widely used for building web applications, desktop software, mobile applications, and more. C# is known for its simplicity, strong type checking, and ability to work with the .NET ecosystem, including libraries for web development, data access, and more.

Here's a detailed discussion of C# features with code examples:

1. Variables and Data Types
C# supports various data types such as integers, floating-point numbers, booleans, characters, and more.

csharp
Copy
int age = 30;                 // Integer
double height = 5.9;          // Double (floating-point number)
char initial = 'R';           // Char
bool isStudent = false;       // Boolean
string name = "John";         // String
2. Control Structures
C# provides traditional control structures like if-else, switch, for, and while loops.

If-Else Example:
csharp
Copy
int number = 10;

if (number > 0)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Number is positive.");
}
else if (number < 0)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Number is negative.");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Number is zero.");
}
Switch-Case Example:
csharp
Copy
int day = 3;
switch (day)
{
    case 1:
        Console.WriteLine("Monday");
        break;
    case 2:
        Console.WriteLine("Tuesday");
        break;
    case 3:
        Console.WriteLine("Wednesday");
        break;
    default:
        Console.WriteLine("Invalid day");
        break;
}
For Loop Example:
csharp
Copy
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Iteration {i}");
}
While Loop Example:
csharp
Copy
int i = 0;
while (i < 5)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Iteration {i}");
    i++;
}
3. Functions (Methods)
In C#, functions are defined within classes. A function in C# may return a value, take parameters, and may not return anything (void).

csharp
Copy
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        int result = Add(5, 7);    // Calling the function
        Console.WriteLine("Sum is: " + result);
    }

    // Function that returns an integer
    static int Add(int a, int b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }
}
In the above example, the Add function takes two parameters a and b, and returns their sum.

4. Classes and Objects
C# is object-oriented, meaning it supports classes and objects. You can define classes that encapsulate properties and methods, and then create objects of these classes.

Class and Object Example:
csharp
Copy
using System;

class Car
{
    // Properties
    public string Make { get; set; }
    public string Model { get; set; }
    
    // Method
    public void Drive()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The car is driving.");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Car myCar = new Car();            // Creating an object
        myCar.Make = "Toyota";            // Setting properties
        myCar.Model = "Corolla";
        
        Console.WriteLine($"Car Make: {myCar.Make}, Model: {myCar.Model}");
        myCar.Drive();                   // Calling method
    }
}
In this example, the Car class has two properties (Make and Model) and a method Drive. We then create an object of Car in the Main method and interact with it.

5. Inheritance
C# supports inheritance, which allows you to create a new class based on an existing class.

Inheritance Example:
csharp
Copy
using System;

class Animal
{
    public void Speak()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Animal speaks.");
    }
}

class Dog : Animal
{
    public void Bark()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Dog barks.");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Dog myDog = new Dog();
        myDog.Speak();  // Inherited method
        myDog.Bark();   // Dog-specific method
    }
}
In the example, Dog inherits from Animal, which means it has access to the Speak method from the Animal class.

6. Interfaces
An interface defines a contract that other classes must follow. It defines methods without implementing them, and classes that implement the interface must provide the method implementations.

Interface Example:
csharp
Copy
using System;

interface IShape
{
    double Area();
}

class Circle : IShape
{
    public double Radius { get; set; }

    public double Area()
    {
        return Math.PI * Radius * Radius;
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        IShape shape = new Circle { Radius = 5 };
        Console.WriteLine($"Area of Circle: {shape.Area()}");
    }
}
In this example, IShape defines the method Area(), and Circle provides the actual implementation.

7. Delegates and Events
A delegate is a type that represents references to methods with a particular parameter list and return type. Events are built on delegates, and they are used to provide notifications to other parts of the program.

Delegate Example:
csharp
Copy
using System;

public delegate void Notify();  // Delegate definition

class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Notify notify = new Notify(SendNotification);  // Delegate instantiation
        notify();  // Calling delegate
    }

    static void SendNotification()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Notification Sent!");
    }
}
In this example, the delegate Notify is created, and we assign it the method SendNotification. The delegate is then invoked to execute the method.

8. LINQ (Language Integrated Query)
LINQ is a powerful feature in C# that allows you to query collections such as arrays, lists, and databases in a declarative way.

LINQ Example:
csharp
Copy
using System;
using System.Linq;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };

        var evenNumbers = from n in numbers
                          where n % 2 == 0
                          select n;

        foreach (var num in evenNumbers)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(num);
        }
    }
}
In this example, LINQ is used to query an array of integers and select even numbers.

9. Exception Handling
C# provides a robust exception handling model that includes try, catch, finally, and throw keywords.

Exception Handling Example:
csharp
Copy
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        try
        {
            int result = Divide(10, 0);  // Division by zero
        }
        catch (DivideByZeroException ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Error: " + ex.Message);
        }
        finally
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Execution completed.");
        }
    }

    static int Divide(int a, int b)
    {
        return a / b;
    }
}
In this example, the program tries to divide by zero, which triggers a DivideByZeroException. The exception is caught, and an error message is printed.

10. Asynchronous Programming
C# also supports asynchronous programming using the async and await keywords, allowing for non-blocking operations.

Asynchronous Example:
csharp
Copy
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
    static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Task Started...");
        await LongRunningTask();
        Console.WriteLine("Task Completed!");
    }

    static async Task LongRunningTask()
    {
        await Task.Delay(3000);  // Simulating a delay of 3 seconds
        Console.WriteLine("Task is running...");
    }
}
In this example, LongRunningTask simulates a delay of 3 seconds, and the await keyword ensures that the program doesn't block while waiting for the task to complete.

Conclusion
C# is a powerful and versatile language that is ideal for building a wide range of applications. From simple console applications to complex web services and mobile applications, C# provides all the tools you need for modern software development. By mastering these fundamental features and concepts, you can write robust and maintainable code in C#.


To execute C# programs and set up the environment, follow these steps. I'll walk you through how to set up your development environment and execute a simple "Hello World" program.

1. Set up C# Development Environment
To run C# programs, you'll need to install the necessary tools on your machine.

Step 1: Install Visual Studio (for Windows)
Visual Studio is a full-featured IDE that supports C# development. Follow these steps:

Download Visual Studio: Go to the official site Visual Studio Downloads.
Install Visual Studio: Choose the Community edition (free) and run the installer.
Select Workloads: During the installation, make sure to select the .NET Desktop Development workload, which includes C# development tools and libraries.
Step 2: Install Visual Studio Code (VSCode) (for Windows/macOS/Linux)
Alternatively, if you prefer a lightweight editor like VS Code, you can follow these steps:

Download Visual Studio Code: Go to VS Code Downloads.
Install C# Extension: Open VS Code and go to the Extensions view (Ctrl + Shift + X). Search for C# by Microsoft and install it.
Step 3: Install .NET SDK (if not included)
Make sure you have the .NET SDK installed, as it provides the necessary runtime for compiling and running C# programs.

Download .NET SDK: Go to Download .NET.
Install: Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
Once installed, verify by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

bash
Copy
dotnet --version
You should see the installed version number of the .NET SDK.

2. Create and Run a Simple C# Program
Step 1: Create a New C# Project
To create a simple console application in C#, you can use the dotnet CLI (command-line interface).

Open a terminal/command prompt.
Create a new directory for your project, if needed:
bash
Copy
mkdir HelloWorldApp
cd HelloWorldApp
Create a new C# console application:
bash
Copy
dotnet new console -n HelloWorldApp
This command generates the basic files for a console application in a folder named HelloWorldApp.

Step 2: Write C# Code
Open the project folder in your preferred code editor (VSCode or Visual Studio).
Navigate to the Program.cs file (it’s the main entry point of your application).
You should see the default template code:

csharp
Copy
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
You can modify the message if you want. For example:

csharp
Copy
Console.WriteLine("Welcome to C# programming!");
Step 3: Build and Run the Program
To run the C# program, follow these steps:

Build the Application: Open the terminal in the project folder and run:

bash
Copy
dotnet build
Run the Application: After building, run the application using:

bash
Copy
dotnet run
This should display the message Welcome to C# programming! (or the default message) in the terminal.

3. Code Example: C# Console Program
Here’s an example of a simple C# console program that asks for user input and displays a personalized message:

csharp
Copy
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Enter your name:");
        string name = Console.ReadLine();
        
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, " + name + "! Welcome to C# programming.");
    }
}
Steps to Run This Code:
Open your terminal in the project folder.
Build the project:
bash
Copy
dotnet build
Run the project:
bash
Copy
dotnet run
The program will ask for your name, and then greet you with the message.

4. Using Visual Studio (VS)
If you're using Visual Studio:

Create a Project: Open Visual Studio and select Create a new project.
Choose Console App (.NET Core) or Console App (.NET Framework) (depending on the version of .NET you're using).
Write your code in the Program.cs file.
Press Ctrl+F5 to build and run the application.
5. Using Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
Open your project folder in VSCode.
Install the C# extension from the Extensions tab.
Press F5 or use the terminal to run:
bash
Copy
dotnet run
Conclusion
By following these steps, you can set up a C# development environment, write a simple "Hello World" program, and run it. You can expand from there by exploring more advanced topics like object-oriented programming, LINQ, and ASP.NET for building web applications.
