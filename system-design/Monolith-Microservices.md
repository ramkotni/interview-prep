o convert a monolithic application to microservices, you need a clear strategy for breaking down the monolith, deploying the services to the cloud, ensuring non-functional requirements (like availability, scaling, and load balancing), and following best practices for governance and code quality. Below is a detailed step-by-step guide, followed by a flow diagram that explains the process.

Step-by-Step Instructions for Interviewer Whiteboard Session:
1. Understand the Current Monolith
Identify the Boundaries: Identify and understand the monolithic application, which could consist of various modules such as user management, order processing, payment, and inventory.

Group Functionality: Break down the monolith into high-level business domains (e.g., User, Order, Payment, etc.) and identify how tightly coupled they are.

Prepare the System for Decomposition: Make sure the current system is decoupled as much as possible, to prepare for migration to microservices.

2. Define Microservices Architecture
Services per Business Domain: Break the application into independent microservices based on business domains. For example:

User Service: Handles user authentication, registration, and profile management.

Order Service: Handles order creation, update, and history tracking.

Payment Service: Manages payment transactions and payment processing.

Inventory Service: Manages product stock, pricing, and availability.

Service Communication: Microservices need to communicate with each other. Typically, REST APIs or gRPC for synchronous communication and messaging queues (like RabbitMQ or Kafka) for asynchronous communication are used.

3. Define the Database Strategy
Decentralized Databases: Each microservice should have its own database to ensure they are decoupled. For example, the Order Service might use a relational database, while the Inventory Service might use a NoSQL database.

Data Consistency: Implement eventual consistency where necessary and consider patterns like Event Sourcing or CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) if needed.

4. Develop and Deploy Microservices
Independent Service Development: Each service can be developed independently using the appropriate technology stack (Java, Python, Node.js, etc.).

Containerization: Containerize each microservice using Docker to ensure consistency across different environments.

CI/CD Pipeline: Implement a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions to automate testing, building, and deployment of each service.

Cloud Deployment: Choose a cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP) and use managed services for deploying microservices. For example, AWS ECS or Kubernetes for container orchestration.

5. Implement Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
Availability:

Use multi-region deployment to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

Implement auto-scaling based on demand to ensure that microservices scale dynamically.

Use load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple instances of the service.

Scalability:

Use cloud-based auto-scaling features to scale services up or down as required.

Partition data and workloads to support horizontal scaling.

Load Balancing:

Use a load balancer (like AWS ALB, NGINX, or Kubernetes Ingress) to distribute traffic evenly across multiple instances of each microservice.

Implement API Gateway to manage incoming requests, handle authentication, routing, and rate limiting.

Monitoring & Logging:

Use centralized logging (e.g., ELK Stack, AWS CloudWatch) and monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track service health and performance.

Set up alerting based on critical thresholds (e.g., error rates, latency, resource consumption).

Governance:

Enforce coding standards, and use linters and code quality tools (e.g., SonarQube) in the CI/CD pipeline.

Implement API versioning and documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI) to ensure that services can evolve without breaking consumers.

Establish security protocols (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT, TLS encryption) to protect the communication between services.

6. Continuous Improvement
Refactor: Once microservices are deployed, continuously refactor services for performance improvements, scalability, and technical debt reduction.

Tech Debt Management: Use tools like SonarQube to ensure clean code practices and prevent accumulation of tech debt.

Evolving Architecture: Continuously review the architecture and incorporate new technologies or patterns (like Serverless, Service Mesh, or Event-Driven architecture) as the system grows.
