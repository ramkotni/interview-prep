What is Circuit Breaker Pattern in Microservices?

The Circuit Breaker pattern is a design pattern used in microservices to enhance system resilience and fault tolerance. It acts like an electrical circuit breaker by preventing an application from repeatedly trying to execute an operation that is likely to fail, which can lead to cascading failures across the system.

What is a Circuit Breaker Pattern?
The Circuit Breaker pattern is like a safety switch for your microservices. Imagine you have an online store that relies on a payment service. If that payment service starts failing repeatedly, instead of your store trying to contact it over and over (which could make things worse), the circuit breaker “trips” and stops any further attempts for a while. let's understand circuit breaker pattern with this example:

Your store makes a request to the payment service to process a payment. Everything works fine.
Suddenly, the payment service has issues and fails three times in a row.
The circuit breaker trips and enters an "open" state. Now, when your store tries to contact the payment service, it immediately gets an error response instead of trying to connect again.
After a set time, the circuit breaker changes to a "half-open" state. It allows a few test requests to see if the payment service is back online.
If those requests succeed, the circuit breaker resets to "closed," and everything goes back to normal. If they fail, it stays open longer, giving the payment service more time to recover.

Characteristics of Circuit Breaker Pattern
Below are some of the characteristics of Circuit Breaker Patterns in Microservices include:

Circuit Breaker enhances fault tolerance by isolating and managing failures in individual services.
It continuously monitors interactions between services to detect issues in real time.
Also useful in temporarily stops requests to failing services, preventing cascading failures and minimizing disruptions.
It Provides fallback responses or error messages to clients during service failures, ensuring graceful degradation.
It Automatically transitions back to normal operation when the failing service recovers, improving system reliability
Working and Different States in Circuit Breaker Pattern
The Circuit Breaker pattern typically operates in three main states: Closed, Open, and Half-Open. Each state represents a different phase in the management of interactions between services. Here's an explanation of each state:

Closed State
In the Closed state, the circuit breaker operates normally, allowing requests to flow through between services.
During this phase, the circuit breaker monitors the health of the downstream service by collecting and analyzing metrics such as response times, error rates, or timeouts..
Open State
When the monitored metrics breach predetermined thresholds, signaling potential issues with the downstream service, the circuit breaker transitions to the Open state.
In the Open state, the circuit breaker immediately stops forwarding requests to the failing service, effectively isolating it.
This helps prevent cascading failures and maintains system stability by ensuring that clients receive timely feedback, even when services encounter issues.
Half-Open State
After a specified timeout period in the Open state, transitions to Half-Open state.
Allows a limited number of trial requests to pass through to the downstream service.
Monitors responses to determine service recovery.
If trial requests succeed, indicating service recovery, transitions back to Closed state.
If trial requests fail, service issues persist.
May transition back to Open state or remain in Half-Open state for further evaluation.

Steps to Implement Circuit Breaker Pattern
Below are the steps to implement Circuit Breaker Pattern:

Step 1: Identify Dependencies: Going for the external services that will bring interactions and make the microservice functional in turn.
Step 2: Choose a Circuit Breaker Library: Choose a circuit breaker library from these existing libraries, or create your own framework that you are familiar with, based on your programming language and platform.
Step 3: Integrate Circuit Breaker into Code: Make sure to insert the selected circuit breaker library into your microservices code base.
Step 4: Define Failure Thresholds: Set boundaries for faults and time-outs that turn the mechanism of the circuit breaker to open.
Step 5: Implement Fallback Mechanisms: Include whenever the circuit has open or close requests, the fallback mechanism should be implemented.
Step 6: Monitor Circuit Breaker Metrics: Use the statistics built into the circuit braker library to see the health an beahviour of your services. Such evaluation measurements includes number of successful/unsuccessful requests, status of the circuit breaker, and error rates.
Step 7: Tune Configuration Parameters: Tuning configuration parameters like timeouts, thresholds, and retry methods in accordance to behavior of your microservices and your application requirements.
Step 8: Test Circuit Breaker Behavior: Perform live testing of your circuit breaker during different operating states including normal function, failure scenarios (high load), and fault condition.
Step 9: Deploy and Monitor: Move/deploy your microservice with circuit breaker, into your production environment.
Use Cases of Circuit Breaker Pattern
Below are the use cases of circuit breaker pattern:

When microservices are communicating with one over the network through the pattern of the Circuit breaker, the document helps to deal with the network failures and with unavailability of service or with slow responses.
That, in doing so, it avoids collateral damage of failures by serving as a barrier between a final service and providing alternative options when failure occurs.
That is, the microservices are the APIs or services which may be external or from other parties.
This Circuit Breaker pattern can be included as a contingency to mitigate against failures in the integrations, enabling the whole system to stay functional even when the external parties are affected by unforeseen issues.
Service instances could be split by circuit breakers together with load balancers in the same time to carry incoming traffic to various instance of that service.
When a service failure occur, the circuit breakers redirect traffic from the failing instance to a healthy instance, meaning that requests are still processed in case of a further failures.
Benefits of Circuit Breaker Pattern
The Circuit Breaker pattern offers several key benefits that enhance the resilience and reliability of microservices:

By stopping calls to a failing service, the circuit breaker helps prevent the entire system from being overwhelmed. This means one service's issues won't bring down others that rely on it.
It allows the application to handle failures gracefully, returning fallback responses or errors without continuously attempting to reach an unresponsive service. This keeps the system running smoothly for users.
When a service fails, the circuit breaker provides a cooldown period before attempting to reconnect. This gives the failing service time to recover, reducing the chances of repeated failures during its recovery process.
Instead of users experiencing long delays or crashes due to repeated failed requests, they receive quick responses (like error messages or alternative options). This keeps them informed and improves their overall experience.
Challenges of Circuit Breaker Pattern in Microservices
Below are some challenges of circuit breaker pattern in microservices:

Implementing a circuit breaker adds an extra layer of complexity to the system. Developers need to manage its states (open, closed, half-open) and ensure it integrates well with existing services.
Properly tuning the parameters for timeout, failure thresholds, and recovery periods can be tricky. If these settings aren’t optimized, it could lead to either too many failed attempts or unnecessary service disruptions.
Testing circuit breaker behavior can be challenging in a development environment. Simulating real-world failure scenarios and ensuring that the circuit breaker responds as expected requires careful planning.
When multiple services use circuit breakers, understanding the interdependencies and potential points of failure can become complex. This can lead to confusion about which service is causing issues.
When to use Circuit Breaker Pattern
Use Circuit breaker pattern when:

You rely on third-party services or APIs that are known to have failures, using a circuit breaker can help manage those outages without overwhelming your system.
When dealing with services that can experience high response times, a circuit breaker can prevent excessive waiting and keep your application responsive by quickly returning fallback responses.
For operations that consume significant resources (like database queries or external API calls), a circuit breaker can help avoid overloading the system when failures occur.
In a microservices architecture, where services communicate frequently, a circuit breaker can protect each service from failures in others, maintaining overall system stability.
If a service typically requires time to recover after a failure (like restarting or rebooting), implementing a circuit breaker can help prevent repeated attempts to connect during that recovery phase.
