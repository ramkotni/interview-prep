CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) Pattern

CQRS separates the read and write operations of a data store. Commands (write operations) update the state, while queries (read operations) fetch data from a different model optimized for reads.

What is the CQRS Design Pattern?
CQRS, is a design pattern that divides the task of managing commands and inquiries among several components. Separating the methods for reading and publishing data is the primary goal of the CQRS architectural pattern. It separates the read and update operations on a datastore into two separate models: Queries and Commands, respectively.

Managing the data handled by software systems becomes more difficult as their complexity increases.
Implementing CQRS in our application can maximize its performance, scalability, and security.
Problem with traditional architectures and how CQRS pattern solves it?
Traditional architectures often face challenges in handling high loads and managing complex data requirements. In these systems, the same model is used for both reading (fetching data) and writing (updating data), which can lead to performance issues. As the application grows, handling large read and write requests together becomes harder, creating bottlenecks and slowing down responses.

CQRS solves this by separating read and write operations into distinct models.

This means write requests (commands) and read requests (queries) are processed independently, optimizing each for its specific task.
As a result, CQRS allows systems to handle higher traffic efficiently, improves performance, and simplifies scaling by allowing independent optimization of read and write parts.
Basic Architecture of CQRS Design Pattern
Commands:
Commands are instructions that indicate a desired change in the state of an entity. These commands execute operations such as Insert, Update, and Delete.
They do not return data, but instead, change the application server’s state.
Each command is an object containing the name of the operation along with the necessary data to perform that operation.
CommandHandlers:
CommandHandlers interpret these commands and return an event. This event can be a successful event or a failure event depending on the outcome of the command.
A successful event is produced if the command is successful, and a failure event is produced if it is unsuccessful.
Queries:
Information can be retrieved from a database using queries. No changes are made to the data; query objects only return it. Data retrieval techniques will only be comprised of queries.
They are used to read data from the database and return it to the client for display in the user interface.
The QueryHandlers interpret the queries and return query values.
Relationship between CQS and CQRS
Command Query Separation (CQS) and CQRS are related in that CQRS extends upon the fundamental concept of CQS. To put it simply, this is how they are related:

CQS: It is a programming principle that says you should separate operations that change data (commands) from those that read data (queries). If you have a method, for instance, it should either return something or update something, but not both.
CQRS: By dividing the design of the entire system into two sections—one for managing commands (writing or modifying data) and another for managing queries (reading data), CQRS expands on this idea. Each side can have its own database or model to optimize how they work.
So, CQS is the basic rule, and CQRS is like an advanced version of it used for bigger systems where you want to handle reading and writing differently.

When to use CQRS Design Pattern?
You should use the CQRS design pattern when your application has different types of operations—like when reading data is very frequent and writing data is complex or infrequent. Here are some common scenarios where CQRS is helpful:

Handling complex queries: If your application needs to perform complicated read operations (queries), separating the read and write sides can optimize performance.
Scalability: When you need to scale reading and writing operations independently, CQRS allows you to optimize each side separately for better scalability.
Event-driven systems: In systems where changes trigger events, CQRS works well with event sourcing to handle complex workflows.
When data models differ: If the way you store data for writing is different from how it should be optimized for reading, CQRS helps by keeping separate models.
CQRS is best used when you need flexibility and performance in applications with high complexity in reading and writing data.

How to Sync Databases with CQRS Design Pattern?
Synchronizing databases in a system that follows the CQRS pattern can be challenging due to the separation of the write and read sides of the application.

Here is how you can handle the synchronization:

Step 1: Write to the Command Database: When you make changes (create, update, delete), they are first saved in the command database. This database is optimized for handling write operations.
Step 2: Generate Events: After the write operation is successful, the system generates events that describe what changed (like “Order Created” or “User Updated”). These events serve as notifications about the updates.
Step 3: Update the Query Database: The read database, optimized for fast queries, listens for these events and applies the changes to its own copy of the data. This way, the query database gets updated with the latest information.
Step 4: Eventual Consistency: The key idea is that the query database doesn’t have to update immediately. There can be a slight delay, but eventually, both databases will sync, ensuring consistency over time.
This approach ensures that the systems are synchronized, with the command side focusing on data integrity and the query side on performance.

Example of CQRS Design Pattern
Let’s understand CQRS Design Pattern through the example of E-commerce Website:

Scenario:


In our E-commerce microservices architecture, we’re introducing a new approach to database design using the CQRS pattern. We’ve decided to split our databases into two separate parts to better manage our data and improve performance.


Firstly, we’ll have a write database that focuses on handling all write operations, such as creating and updating orders.
This database will be optimized for transactional consistency and relational data modeling, making it suitable for managing the core data changes.
Secondly, we’ll introduce a read database dedicated to handling read operations, such as querying for order details and order history.
This database will be designed for high performance and scalability, using a NoSQL database like MongoDB or Cassandra.
Synchronization in Databases
To keep these two databases in sync, we’ll implement a messaging system using Apache Kafka. Kafka’s publish/subscribe model will allow us to propagate changes from the write database to the read database in real-time, ensuring that the data remains consistent across both databases.

Benefits of using CQRS Design Pattern
Below are the benefits of CQRS Design Pattern:

Improved Scalability:
Each model can be optimized for a particular use case by splitting the duties of commands and queries.
As a result, it is possible to optimize the query model for high read performance while the command model can be enhanced for high write performance.
The system can scale more effectively and handle more complicated business rules due to this separation.
Improved performance:
The system can outperform a conventional strategy that employs a single model for both reads and writes by tailoring each model to its particular use case.
The command model can be created to guarantee data consistency and integrity while the query model can be created to offer quick access to data.
Maintainability:
By simplifying the system’s understanding and modification, CQRS can help increase maintainability. The codebase may become more modular and simpler to understand if the duties of commands and queries are divided.
This can make it simpler to add new features and modify the system without creating bugs or affecting functionality.
Challenges of using CQRS Design Pattern
Below are the challenges of using CQRS Design Pattern:

Complexity: Your system may become more complex if you use CQRS, particularly if you are unfamiliar with the pattern. It can be difficult to coordinate data synchronization, manage distinct read and write models, and guarantee consistency between the two.
Consistency: Maintaining consistency between the read and write models can be challenging, especially in distributed systems where data updates may not propagate immediately. Careful planning and execution are necessary to guarantee stability over time without compromising scalability or performance.
Data Synchronization: It might be difficult to keep the read and write models in sync, particularly when handling complicated data transformations or big data sets. It can be beneficial to use strategies like message queues or event sources.
Performance Overhead: Implementing CQRS can introduce performance overhead, especially if not done carefully. For example, using event sourcing for the write model can impact write performance, while keeping the read model updated in real-time can impact read performance.
Operational Complexity: Operational complexity may rise while managing two databases or data storage (one for read and one for write). This covers duties including monitoring, backup and restoration, and guaranteeing data durability and high availability.
Best Practices for implementing CQRS pattern
Below are some of the best practices for implementing CQRS pattern:

Separate Read and Write Models Carefully:
Clearly divide the system into models for reading data (queries) and writing data (commands). This separation helps keep each model simple and optimized for its specific task.
Use Asynchronous Communication When Needed:
Since commands and queries are separated, consider using asynchronous messaging for commands. This helps the system stay responsive and handle high traffic efficiently, even if some operations take longer.
Keep Commands and Queries as Simple as Possible:
Design commands to focus only on changing data (like “CreateOrder” or “UpdateUser”) and queries only on retrieving data (like “GetOrderDetails”). Avoid mixing read and write logic in either part to keep things clean and maintainable.
Embrace Event Sourcing for Data Consistency:
Event sourcing can be paired with CQRS to keep a record of all changes. Each change is saved as an event, and the current state is rebuilt from these events. This can make it easier to track history, recover data, or audit changes.
Consider the Complexity of Your System:
CQRS adds some complexity, so it’s best suited for systems with high read and write demands or complex business rules. For simpler systems, CQRS might be overkill and add unnecessary development overhead.
Event Sourcing and CQRS
Event Sourcing and CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) are patterns often used together to manage data in complex systems.

Event Sourcing is a way of storing data by capturing every change as a sequence of events, rather than just saving the latest state. So, instead of updating a user’s balance directly, each transaction (like “Deposit 100” or “Withdraw 50”) is recorded as an event. The current state can be recreated by replaying these events, which helps track history, undo changes, or audit actions.
CQRS separates the responsibilities of reading and writing data. One part of the system handles commands, while another part handles queries. This separation allows each side to be optimized separately, making the system more efficient, especially under heavy load.
Together, Event Sourcing and CQRS can handle high data demands, ensure better performance, and provide a detailed history of all changes in a system.
