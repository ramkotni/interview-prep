Microservices is an architectural pattern where an application is composed of small, independent services that communicate over a network. Each service is designed to perform a specific business function and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.


Key Characteristics:
Independence: Each service is self-contained and can be developed and deployed independently.
Single Responsibility: Each service focuses on a specific business capability.
Decentralized Data Management: Each service manages its own database.
Communication: Services communicate using lightweight protocols like HTTP/REST, gRPC, or messaging queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka).

Example: E-Commerce Application
1. Order Service
Handles order creation, updates, and tracking.
Exposes REST APIs like:
POST /orders (Create an order)
GET /orders/{id} (Get order details)
2. Inventory Service
Manages product stock levels.
Exposes APIs like:
GET /inventory/{productId} (Check stock)
POST /inventory/{productId}/decrease (Reduce stock after an order)
3. Payment Service
Processes payments for orders.
Exposes APIs like:
POST /payments (Process payment)
GET /payments/{id} (Get payment status)
4. Notification Service
Sends notifications (e.g., email, SMS) to customers.
Exposes APIs like:
POST /notifications (Send notification)

Communication Example:
Order Creation Flow:
Step 1: The client sends a request to the Order Service to create an order.
Step 2: The Order Service calls the Inventory Service to check and reduce stock.
Step 3: The Order Service calls the Payment Service to process the payment.
Step 4: Once successful, the Notification Service is triggered to notify the customer.

Benefits:
Scalability: Services can be scaled independently based on demand.
Flexibility: Teams can use different technologies for different services.
Fault Isolation: Failure in one service doesn’t bring down the entire system.
Challenges:
Complexity: Managing multiple services increases operational complexity.
Communication Overhead: Requires robust inter-service communication mechanisms.
Data Consistency: Ensuring consistency across services can be challenging.
Microservices are commonly implemented using frameworks like Spring Boot (Java), Express.js (Node.js), or Flask (Python).

1. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
Pattern: Separates read and write operations into different models.
Use Case: Improves scalability and performance in systems with heavy read/write operations.
Example:
Command: A service updates a user profile in the database.
Query: A separate service fetches user details for display.

2. Circuit Breaker
Pattern: Prevents cascading failures by stopping requests to a failing service.
Use Case: Protects the system from overloading when a downstream service is unavailable.
Example:
A payment service fails; the circuit breaker opens and returns a fallback response like "Payment service is unavailable."

3. SAGA
Pattern: Manages distributed transactions using a series of compensating actions.
Use Case: Ensures consistency in microservices without a global transaction manager.
Example:
Order Service: Creates an order.
Payment Service: Deducts payment.
If payment fails, the SAGA rolls back the order creation.

4. Sidecar
Pattern: Deploys auxiliary components (e.g., logging, monitoring) alongside the main service.
Use Case: Adds cross-cutting concerns without modifying the main service.
Example:
A sidecar container handles logging for a web application in Kubernetes.

5. Service Discovery
Pattern: Dynamically locates services in a distributed system.
Use Case: Avoids hardcoding service locations.
Example:
A client queries a service registry (e.g., Eureka) to find the IP of the Order Service.

6. Strangler Fig
Pattern: Gradually replaces a legacy system by building new functionality around it.
Use Case: Migrates systems incrementally without downtime.
Example:
A legacy monolith is replaced by microservices one feature at a time.

7. API Gateway
Pattern: Acts as a single entry point for client requests, routing them to appropriate services.
Use Case: Simplifies client communication with multiple microservices.
Example:
An API Gateway routes /orders to the Order Service and /payments to the Payment Service.

8. Bulkhead
Pattern: Isolates system components to prevent failures from spreading.
Use Case: Ensures one failing service doesn’t affect others.
Example:
Separate thread pools for Order Service and Payment Service ensure that a failure in one doesn’t overload the other.
