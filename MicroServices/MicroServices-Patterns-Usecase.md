1. API Gateway Pattern
Use Case: Centralized entry point for all client requests.
When to Use: When you need to aggregate multiple services, handle cross-cutting concerns (e.g., authentication, logging), or simplify client interactions.
Example: A single API gateway for an e-commerce platform managing product, order, and user services.
2. Database per Service Pattern
Use Case: Each service has its own database to ensure loose coupling.
When to Use: When services need to be independently scalable and maintain their own data.
Example: A user service with a PostgreSQL database and an order service with a MongoDB database.
3. Service Discovery Pattern
Use Case: Dynamically locate services in a distributed system.
When to Use: When services are deployed dynamically, and their locations (IP/port) are not fixed.
Example: Using Eureka or Consul for service registration and discovery.
4. Circuit Breaker Pattern
Use Case: Prevent cascading failures by stopping calls to failing services.
When to Use: When a service depends on unreliable or slow external services.
Example: A payment service halting calls to a third-party payment gateway during downtime.
5. Event Sourcing Pattern
Use Case: Store changes as a sequence of events rather than the current state.
When to Use: When you need an audit trail or to rebuild the state from events.
Example: A banking application tracking all transactions as events.
6. Saga Pattern
Use Case: Manage distributed transactions across multiple services.
When to Use: When a business process spans multiple services and requires rollback on failure.
Example: An order service coordinating inventory and payment services.
7. Strangler Fig Pattern
Use Case: Gradually replace a monolithic application with microservices.
When to Use: When migrating legacy systems to microservices incrementally.
Example: Replacing a monolithic user management module with a user microservice.
8. Bulkhead Pattern
Use Case: Isolate failures to prevent them from affecting the entire system.
When to Use: When you need to ensure that failures in one service donâ€™t impact others.
Example: Separating thread pools for different services in a travel booking system.
9. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) Pattern
Use Case: Separate read and write operations for scalability and performance.
When to Use: When read and write workloads have different performance requirements.
Example: A reporting service with optimized read models and a separate write model.
10. Sidecar Pattern
Use Case: Deploy auxiliary tasks (e.g., logging, monitoring) alongside the main service.
When to Use: When you need to offload cross-cutting concerns from the main service.
Example: A sidecar container for logging in a Kubernetes pod.
11. Anti-Corruption Layer Pattern
Use Case: Translate communication between microservices and legacy systems.
When to Use: When integrating with legacy systems to avoid polluting microservices with legacy logic.
Example: A layer translating SOAP responses to REST for a modern service.
These patterns are chosen based on the specific requirements of scalability, fault tolerance, data consistency, and system complexity.
