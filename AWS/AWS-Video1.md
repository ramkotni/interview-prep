Hands on AWS Account creation


Let us try to understand pay as you go model ..

when you buy a laptop, processor AMD

along with process, we also check cores 2

what is the Memory RAM and what is the storage

also Operating system like windows or ubuntu etc

price will vary based on the configuation ..

Types of cloud computing:

private cloud, public cloud

IAAS -- infrastructure as a service
on premise, for your laptop you have full control, you can do
any installations, because you are the admin ..
In cloud if you rent one server, cloud same level of permission ..

AWS lo 200 service .. EC2 service .. Elastic Compute Cloud ..you will have full control

2. PAAS Platform as a Service (PAAS)

No need to maintain infrastructure. only focus on product or
application development... ex: Elastic Beanstalk
it will automatically create servers, load balancer ...

cloud is providing everything ..platform ...
only application hosting ...

no knowledge in cloud then team will go elastic bean stalk

3. SAAS Software as service

no need to manage both infra and software /application

ex: Dynamo DB, Zoom, Google meet

dynamo db .. no need to create any server ...
dbase ... DB aas and DB Saas ..
