Hi, I'm Ram Kotni. I have 16 years of experience in Java Fullstack technologies, primarily working as a backend developer utilizing core Java concepts, including JDK 8, JDK 11, and executor frameworks. I have extensive experience with frameworks such as Spring, Hibernate, and Spring Boot. I've both exposed and consumed downstream REST endpoints using REST templates and Feign clients, and I've worked on microservices from scratch as well as existing ones, employing various patterns like Saga, Discovery, API Gateway, and Circuit Breaker.

I monitor application logs using Splunk dashboards and track memory spikes with Grafana and AppDynamics dashboards. Deployment is managed through Jenkins CI/CD pipelines, and I'm proficient in writing Jenkins scripts. I also maintain AWS EC2 instances and am well-versed in using S3 buckets, IAM policies, and CloudWatch.

As a developer, I ensure the code is testable by writing JUnit test cases using the Mockito framework, aiming for 90% code coverage with SonarQube plugins. I handle authentication and authorization of user requests using JSON Web Tokens and AWS IAM policies. I've worked extensively with Kafka as both a consumer and producer, managing different Kafka topics, consumer groups, partition offsets, and configurations.

My database experience includes Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, and DynamoDB. On the frontend, I have experience with JavaScript, Angular, HTML, CSS, and some exposure to React.js.

Roles and Responsibilities:
Follow agile methodologies with two-week sprints, participating in all agile ceremonies such as planning, review, refinement, retrospective, and daily stand-up meetings.
Prepare quarterly roadmaps during JAD(Joint Application Development) sessions, prioritize user stories, and work on them accordingly.
Review pull requests from team members, manage deployments, and provide demos to stakeholders in UAT environments.
Deploy to different environments, including Linux.
Write JUnit test cases using the Mockito framework and maintain 85% test coverage with JaCoCo and SonarQube plugins.
Oversee and support offshore team members.
These are the technologies and methodologies I have worked with throughout my career.
