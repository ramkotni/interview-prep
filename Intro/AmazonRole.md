this is Java full stack developer working in Amazon robotics. Mainly the contribution will be the front end, back end and the cloud based responsibilities, mainly focusing more on to the high performance, scalable and distributed systems coming to the back end application have worked us and maintained the high performance scalable back end services using Java, Spring Boot micro services and AWS and implementing a RESTful web services for seamless communication between the robotic systems and the Cloud based platforms, working on the multi threading environment, event driven architecture and real time data processing for optimization of databases, interactions with SQL and non SQL, where coming to the UI part, I build a response UI using React GS in monitor for some control robotic system integrated with back end APIs to ensure that seamless user experience, working with WebSockets, real time data visualization tools and coming to cloud computing part our deploy manager, scalable applications using AWS services, easy to lambda, s, 3d, DynamoDB, RTS, SNS and SQS were implemented by using of Jenkins, GitHub actions, CSD pipelines for AWS, I used to containerize and orchestration tools like Docker and Kubernetes For our applications, we also integrated with IoT integrations with protocols in Qt sub circuits, grcps to facilitate communication between robots and the back end services. Yeah,
Okay, I so as that, I
as architecture like I was mainly focusing more on trip to the like depends upon the project type. So based on the project type, we need to understand about of any exact business requirement. So based on the business requirement, we are going to do the further steps, like involvementing of any categorizing into teams, and from them there, we are going to analysis the what is the level of the architecture, by understanding about from them, what is how much millions, what's a traffic required, and what is the level of networking side, but of the coding side, and as well as the involvementing into the people budget, this all the things which comes under to the core architecting of any particular application as any software for the project. Perspective, I
as a software application dissolve it is involved divine into the structures of a system, including its components, modules and the interfaces. The first step is we need to understand the requirement. We need to make sure that understand the software needs and their constraints. Now we'll define the concepts. Now we need to consider how each component will be performed its specific task, and next dividing into layers. We will separate the applications into layers, each layer responsible for the specific set of functionalities. Next, we will create a prototype. We'll create a prototype for our design and visualize. We use the Visualize diagrams to visualize how the components will interact it. We consider the trade off some of the attributes each other, like content, contract each other. So there will be, always be any trade offs, documentation, 
document, architecture, designing and changes. So we can can understand the design choices maintaining of architects over a time. Coming to the software architecture design patterns we use, we have the two things, layered architecture and a client side client server patterns. In the layered architecture, separate task into the distinct layers, which make the system modular and easy to maintain while coming to the client server pattern works well with the centralized resources like emails and the bank and the banking systems.
So the main consideration is modularity, simplicity, clean architects and the DevOps architecture diagrams you


Q1: What is your role and contribution at Amazon Robotics?
A1: I work as a Java Full Stack Developer at Amazon Robotics. My contributions span front-end, back-end, and cloud-based responsibilities. I focus on building high-performance, scalable, and distributed systems, working with Java, Spring Boot, microservices, and AWS to implement RESTful web services for communication between robotic systems and cloud platforms. Additionally, I work on multi-threading, event-driven architecture, real-time data processing, and database optimizations. On the UI side, I build responsive UIs using ReactJS and integrate them with backend APIs for a seamless user experience.
