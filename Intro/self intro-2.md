Introduction:

"Hi, I'm Ram Kotni, and I have 16 years of experience working in Java Full Stack technologies, with a primary focus on backend development. My expertise centers around core Java concepts, including JDK 8, JDK 11, JDK17 and Java Executor frameworks, which I've used to build efficient, scalable applications."

Professional Summary:

"I’m highly skilled in using frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, and Spring Boot, and have worked on RESTful services extensively, using REST templates and Feign clients to both expose and consume downstream endpoints. In my previous role, I had the opportunity to design microservices from the ground up and enhance existing services, applying key design patterns such as Saga, Discovery, API Gateway, and Circuit Breaker."

Technical Skills:

"My work often involves monitoring application logs through Splunk and tracking memory with Grafana and AppDynamics. I handle deployments via Jenkins CI/CD pipelines and write Jenkins scripts as needed. I also manage AWS resources like EC2, S3, IAM, and CloudWatch, ensuring secure and optimized cloud environments. Additionally, I maintain high code quality, using tools like JUnit with Mockito for testing, aiming for robust coverage with SonarQube."

Database and Frontend Experience:

"I have a solid database background, with experience across Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, and DynamoDB. On the frontend, I’ve worked with JavaScript, Angular, HTML, CSS, and some React.js, giving me a full-stack perspective."

Project Highlight:

"One of my notable projects was at Amazon Robotics, where I worked on a system to improve the efficiency and accuracy of delivery agents through real-time data. This involved using Java 17 and Spring Boot to process data streams and AWS for scalable storage and processing. The project helped me combine my backend expertise with AWS cloud and DevOps practices to make an impact in real-world logistics."

Closing:

"I’m looking forward to bringing my technical experience and collaborative approach to this role and am excited to discuss how my background aligns with the team’s objectives."
