1. Amazon Robotics – Delivery Agent Proctor System


Project Overview


At Amazon Robotics, I worked on the Delivery Agent Proctor project, which focused on improving the efficiency, accuracy, and reliability of delivery agents and robotic-assisted logistics systems. The system played a critical role in real-time monitoring, validation, and analytics of delivery and robotic operations across Amazon fulfillment and distribution centers.



The primary objective was to process high-volume, real-time data generated by robots and delivery agents, ensure compliance with operational rules, and provide actionable insights to downstream systems.

My Role and Responsibilities


I worked as a Senior Backend / Full-Stack Engineer, with a strong focus on:

Designing and developing Java 17 + Spring Boot microservices

Implementing real-time data processing pipelines

Integrating with AWS services

Ensuring scalability, fault tolerance, and low latency



I also participated in architecture discussions, performance optimization, CI/CD automation, and production support.

System Architecture


The application followed a microservices architecture, where each service handled a specific domain such as:

Agent activity tracking

Robotic event ingestion

Rule evaluation and proctoring logic

Reporting and analytics



Services communicated via REST APIs and asynchronous messaging, enabling horizontal scalability and independent deployments.

Data Flow Example


Robots and delivery agents generated real-time telemetry and event data, which was ingested into backend services through secure APIs.

Spring Boot services processed the data, applied business rules (for example, detecting anomalies or violations), and stored results in AWS-backed data stores.

Processed data was then made available to dashboards, alerts, and analytics systems.

AWS and DevOps


The system heavily used AWS, including:

S3 for data storage

Lambda for event-driven processing

Jenkins for CI/CD

Docker for containerization



This setup allowed the platform to scale automatically during peak delivery periods and maintain high availability.
