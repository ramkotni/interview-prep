🔹 Self-Introduction (2–3 minutes version for interviews)

“Thank you for the opportunity. I have over 17 years of experience as a Java Full Stack Developer, where I’ve played roles ranging from Developer, Senior Developer, Technical Lead, to Application Architect.

On the backend, I have deep expertise in Java, J2EE, Spring Boot, Microservices, Hibernate, REST APIs, and I’ve designed and implemented large-scale applications following 12-factor methodology. I’ve also worked extensively with databases like Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and NoSQL solutions like MongoDB and Cassandra.

On the frontend, I’m proficient in Angular, React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, where I’ve built interactive, responsive web applications that integrate seamlessly with backend services.

In addition, I have strong cloud experience with AWS, GCP, Kubernetes, and Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF), where I have migrated applications from monolith to microservices, improving scalability, availability, and performance. I’ve also implemented CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins, Git, and Docker to streamline deployments.

Beyond development, I’ve worked closely with stakeholders and product teams to understand business needs, translate them into technical solutions, and deliver end-to-end implementations. I also mentor junior developers and perform code reviews to ensure quality and best practices.

In short, I bring a strong mix of hands-on coding, architecture design, cloud migration, and leadership experience, which helps me deliver robust, scalable, and business-driven solutions.”

🌟 The 12 Factors (in Simple Words + Easy Hook to Remember)

Think of building an app like running a restaurant 🍴. Each factor is like a rule to keep the restaurant efficient, consistent, and scalable.

1. Codebase → One code, many deployments

👉 Like one recipe book 📖 used to make food in different branches of your restaurant.

2. Dependencies → Declare everything you need

👉 Like writing down all ingredients needed for each dish so nothing is assumed.

3. Config → Keep settings separate from code

👉 Don’t write “salt 2 spoons” directly in the recipe. Instead, keep it in a settings sheet 📝 that can be changed per branch.

4. Backing Services → Treat external services as attached resources

👉 Like treating suppliers (milkman, bakery, delivery truck) as replaceable — if one fails, switch to another without changing the recipe.

5. Build, Release, Run → Separate steps clearly

👉 Build kitchen equipment 🔧, then stock ingredients 📦, then cook 🍳. Each stage is distinct.

6. Processes → Run as stateless processes

👉 Each cook works independently — no personal notes hidden in the kitchen. If one leaves, another can take over.

7. Port Binding → Self-contained app

👉 The restaurant serves food directly 🍔 instead of relying on another shop’s counter. Your app should expose itself (via port).

8. Concurrency → Scale out with more instances

👉 If more customers arrive, hire more cooks 👨‍🍳👩‍🍳 instead of making one cook faster.

9. Disposability → Fast startup and shutdown

👉 Like switching shifts quickly. If a cook leaves, a new one steps in immediately without disrupting service.

10. Dev/Prod Parity → Keep development, testing, and production similar

👉 The test kitchen should look like the real restaurant kitchen — same tools, same layout.

11. Logs → Treat logs as event streams

👉 Like CCTV footage 📹 — don’t store it in the kitchen, just stream it to a central place for monitoring.

12. Admin Processes → Run one-off tasks separately

👉 Inventory check 📦 or deep cleaning 🧹 is done outside of normal daily cooking. Similarly, run database migrations or scripts separately.
