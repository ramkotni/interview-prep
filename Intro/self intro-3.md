================ Interviewer: Hi Ram, can you introduce yourself and tell us a bit about your background?

Ram Kotni: Absolutely! I’m Ram Kotni, and I bring 16 years of experience in IT, where I’ve played multiple Roles – from backend development to leading and architecting full-stack solutions. Over the years, I’ve developed a strong foundation in Spring Boot, Hibernate, and the Spring Framework, with significant experience designing and building microservices from the ground up using patterns like Circuit Breaker, Saga, and Discovery.

In terms of my daily development activities, I’ve always been hands-on. I’m involved in everything from writing clean, efficient code to designing architecture. I typically start my day by reviewing the previous day’s work, ensuring all tasks are aligned with sprint goals, and addressing any blockers that may have come up. I then dive into writing RESTful microservices, building out APIs, and ensuring proper integration with frontend systems and external services.

Deployment is managed through Jenkins CI/CD pipelines, and I'm proficient in writing Jenkins scripts. I've worked extensively with Kafka as both a consumer and producer, managing different Kafka topics, consumer groups, partition offsets, and configurations.

As a lead developer and architect, I also play a key role in designing system architecture, ensuring scalability, fault tolerance, and security of the solutions we develop. I also mentor junior developers, conduct code reviews, and work with cross-functional teams to implement solutions that align with business requirements. Agile ceremonies are a big part of my day too, where I actively participate in sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and review meetings, ensuring timely delivery and that the team is aligned with project objectives.

Interviewer: That’s great! Can you share more about your specific role in the projects you’ve worked on and what you did on a daily basis?

Ram Kotni: Absolutely! In my current role, I lead the Amazon Delivery Tracking System project, a full-stack Java application for real-time delivery tracking.

On a daily basis, my tasks include:

Backend development: I work with Spring Boot to design and develop microservices that handle core features like delivery status, real-time updates, and user management. Frontend collaboration: I work closely with frontend developers, ensuring that the React interfaces we build communicate seamlessly with the backend. AWS management: I deploy the microservices to EC2, manage S3 storage, and set up CloudWatch for monitoring. Security implementation: I ensure JWT authentication is implemented for secure access. Quality control: I write JUnit tests to ensure both functional and non-functional requirements are met before deployment. As a lead developer, I ensure the code is following best practices, and as an architect, I ensure that the architecture is scalable and fault-tolerant.

Previously, at Biogen, I led the development of a full-stack Java application to support their research in neurological diseases like MS and Alzheimer's. My daily activities included:

Microservice development: I built RESTful APIs using Spring Boot to manage clinical trial data, patient records, and drug development data. Database design: I designed and optimized databases using Oracle and Hibernate to handle large volumes of clinical and medical data. Frontend development: I worked with React to develop dashboards and interfaces for real-time access to patient and clinical trial data. Collaboration and mentoring: I mentored junior developers and worked with cross-functional teams to integrate the application with AWS services (EC2, S3, IAM, CloudWatch). Security: I implemented JWT authentication and role-based access controls to ensure compliance with HIPAA and other regulatory standards. Agile methodology: I led the Agile ceremonies, worked on sprint planning, and ensured the team stayed aligned with sprint goals. I also regularly deployed code to UAT, demonstrated the new features to stakeholders, and ensured everything was properly tested using JUnit before going live.
