For example, I used the Stream API to filter and process large datasets in a financial application, reducing code complexity and improving performance.
Explain the difference between HashMap and ConcurrentHashMap.


Answer: HashMap is not thread-safe, while ConcurrentHashMap is thread-safe and allows concurrent reads and writes. For example, in a multi-threaded application, I used ConcurrentHashMap to store user sessions to avoid ConcurrentModificationException.
How does the Garbage Collector work in Java?


Answer: The Garbage Collector automatically reclaims memory by removing unused objects. For example, in a Spring Boot application, I optimized memory usage by ensuring objects were dereferenced after use, allowing the Garbage Collector to clean them up.
What is the difference between final, finally, and finalize?


Answer: final is a keyword to declare constants or prevent inheritance, finally is a block for cleanup in a try-catch statement, and finalize is a method called by the Garbage Collector before object destruction. For example, I used finally to close database connections in a DAO layer.
