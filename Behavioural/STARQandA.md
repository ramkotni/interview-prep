2. Amazon - Improving Web Application Performance
Situation:
You are responsible for improving the performance of an e-commerce website that experiences slow load times and decreased user engagement.

Task:
The task is to optimize the website to load faster, especially for users with slower internet connections.

Action:
You analyze the bottlenecks in the application by profiling the code and identifying slow database queries and unnecessary network calls. You introduce caching for static assets, optimize database queries, and implement lazy loading of images and components.

Result:
The website loads faster, reducing the page load time significantly. This results in improved user engagement and higher conversion rates.

3. Microsoft - Difference Between .NET Core and .NET Framework
Situation:
You're in an interview, and the interviewer asks you to explain the difference between .NET Core and .NET Framework.

Task:
The task is to explain the differences clearly, especially highlighting why one would be chosen over the other.

Action:
You explain that .NET Core is cross-platform and open-source, making it ideal for building applications that need to run on multiple operating systems like Windows, Linux, and macOS. You contrast it with the .NET Framework, which is tied to the Windows ecosystem and is better suited for traditional Windows applications.

Result:
The interviewer gains a clear understanding of the differences between the two frameworks, and you demonstrate your knowledge of the .NET ecosystem and its evolution.

4. Apple - Optimizing an iOS App for Performance
Situation:
You are tasked with optimizing the performance of an iOS app that is running slowly on older devices.

Task:
Your task is to make the app more efficient, ensuring it runs smoothly without consuming excessive memory or CPU.

Action:
You focus on optimizing the app by reducing memory usage and ensuring that heavy tasks are executed on background threads to prevent UI freezing. You use tools like Instruments to profile the app for memory leaks, optimize image loading, and implement hardware acceleration where applicable.

Result:
The app performs faster and more efficiently on older devices, leading to higher user satisfaction and better app store reviews.

5. Facebook - Ensuring Scalable Code
Situation:
You're building a social media platform and need to ensure that the backend can scale as user numbers grow exponentially.

Task:
The task is to design and implement a system that can handle large amounts of data and traffic efficiently while ensuring that the code remains scalable.

Action:
You design the system using microservices to decouple functionality, implement horizontal scaling by deploying multiple instances of services, and use message queues for asynchronous communication between services. You optimize database queries and use caching for high-traffic data.

Result:
The platform scales smoothly to handle a growing number of users, with reduced latency and better performance, even during peak traffic times.

6. Netflix - Ensuring High Availability in a Cloud-Based System
Situation:
You are responsible for designing a cloud-based system that needs to remain operational even in the event of a failure.

Task:
Your task is to ensure high availability of the system, ensuring users can access the service without interruptions.

Action:
You deploy the system across multiple availability zones to avoid a single point of failure. You also set up auto-scaling to dynamically add resources as needed. You use load balancing to distribute traffic evenly and implement redundancy in both databases and servers.

Result:
The system remains highly available and resilient to failures, providing seamless service even during system outages, and improving overall user experience.

7. Tesla - Debugging Complex Systems
Situation:
You encounter a complex bug in an embedded system used in Tesla vehicles, and you need to fix it quickly.

Task:
The task is to debug the system, identify the root cause of the issue, and fix it to prevent further system failures.

Action:
You reproduce the issue in a test environment, gather logs from the system, and use diagnostic tools to analyze the system’s behavior. You isolate problematic components, identify the root cause, and apply a fix while ensuring that all tests pass.

Result:
The issue is resolved without affecting other parts of the system, and the fix is deployed, ensuring the system remains stable.

8. IBM - Explaining Blockchain
Situation:
You are asked in an interview to explain blockchain technology and its practical applications.

Task:
The task is to explain blockchain in a clear and concise way, demonstrating how it can be applied in various industries.

Action:
You explain blockchain as a decentralized and distributed ledger system that allows secure, transparent transactions without relying on a central authority. You highlight its applications in cryptocurrency, supply chain management, healthcare, and finance for ensuring data integrity and transparency.

Result:
The interviewer appreciates your clear understanding of blockchain, and you demonstrate the real-world applications of this technology.

9. Adobe - Ensuring Maintainable Code
Situation:
You're part of a development team working on a large-scale web application, and the codebase is becoming difficult to maintain.

Task:
The task is to ensure that the code remains clean, modular, and maintainable as the project scales.

Action:
You write clean, modular, and reusable code following best practices such as SOLID principles. You ensure that the code is well-documented and follow consistent naming conventions. Additionally, you introduce unit tests and integrate continuous integration to catch issues early.

Result:
The codebase remains easy to maintain, and developers can work on different parts of the system without causing conflicts. This improves the team’s productivity and leads to fewer bugs in the system.

10. Spotify - Handling API Versioning and Compatibility
Situation:
You need to manage the versioning of an API while ensuring backward compatibility for existing users.

Task:
The task is to manage API changes without disrupting existing clients using previous versions.

Action:
You use semantic versioning for APIs and implement versioning in the URL (e.g., /v1/, /v2/) or in the headers. You ensure that new versions of the API don’t break existing functionality by adding new endpoints or making non-breaking changes to the response structure.

Result:
Clients using older versions of the API can continue to function normally, while new features and improvements are available to users who adopt the new version, maintaining both backward compatibility and innovation.
