Tell me about a time you faced a challenging technical problem and how you resolved it. 

Situation:
In my previous role, I was working on a project that involved integrating a deployment in Amazon Robotics. During the process, we encountered a trust store issue in one of the Java programs deployed on the WebLogic server. This issue caused inconsistent responses from the program, which ultimately led to a need to restart the WebLogic server multiple times to mitigate the problem.

Task:
My task was to identify the root cause of the trust store issue, implement a solution to fix the problem, and ensure that transactions could be processed smoothly without further interruptions.

Action:
I began by thoroughly analyzing the WebLogic server logs to check for any error patterns or specific warnings that could point to the root cause. After reviewing the integration documentation, I also investigated the server-level configuration, focusing on the trust store settings. During this analysis, I discovered a discrepancy in one of the deployed Java programs related to how it handled certificates in the trust store.

To resolve the issue, I updated the trust store configuration at the server level, ensuring that the correct certificates were loaded and properly trusted. Additionally, I made necessary changes to the program itself to ensure it could access and validate certificates properly. I also applied system-level settings that ensured the trust store configurations were aligned across all affected systems.

Result:
After implementing the changes, I retested the system and found that the integration was now functioning smoothly. Transactions were processed correctly without inconsistencies or the need for server restarts. The issue was resolved in a timely manner, significantly improving the customerâ€™s transaction experience and minimizing the system downtime. The resolution also helped streamline the deployment process moving forward, preventing similar issues from occurring.
