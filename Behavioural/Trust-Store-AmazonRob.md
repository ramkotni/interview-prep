Tell me about a time you faced a challenging technical problem and how you resolved it. 

Situation: In my previous role, I was working on a project that involved integrating a deployment there we encountered trust store issue from one of the Java Program deployed because of this issue the response of the program was inconsistent and where we end restarting weblogic server.

Task: My task was to identify the root cause of the issue and implement a fix to ensure smooth transactions.

Action: I started by analyzing the logs to identify any patterns or errors. After reviewing the integration documentation, Analyze weblogic server level configuration and made few changes trust store configuration at server level. I found a discrepancy in one of the program is causing the issue and made fix to that program, made system level settings to that programes which resolved the issue.

Result: After implementing the changes and retesting, the integration was smooth, and transactions were processed correctly. The customerâ€™s transaction experience improved, and the issue was resolved in a timely manner, minimizing downtime.
