Tell me about a time you faced a challenging technical problem and how you resolved it. Situation: In my previous role, I was working on a project that involved integrating a third-party payment gateway into our e-commerce platform. During testing, we encountered an issue where transactions were not being processed correctly, and the response from the gateway was inconsistent.
Task: My task was to identify the root cause of the issue and implement a fix to ensure smooth transactions.

Action: I started by analyzing the logs to identify any patterns or errors. After reviewing the integration documentation, I found a discrepancy between the API versions we were using and the one the gateway had recently updated to. I worked closely with the third-party vendor’s support team, and we confirmed the change. I then updated the API endpoints and added proper error handling to handle inconsistencies.

Result: After implementing the changes and retesting, the integration was smooth, and transactions were processed correctly. The customer’s transaction experience improved, and the issue was resolved in a timely manner, minimizing downtime.
