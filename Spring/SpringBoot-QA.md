| **11. How do you create a Spring Boot application?**                             | A Spring Boot application can be created by using Spring Initializr (https://start.spring.io), selecting dependencies, or by creating a new project and adding Spring Boot starter dependencies to the `pom.xml` (Maven) or `build.gradle` (Gradle) files.                                                             |
| **12. What are Spring Boot Profiles?**                                           | Spring Boot Profiles allow you to define different configuration values for different environments (e.g., `dev`, `prod`, `test`). It helps manage application properties for various stages in the lifecycle and allows you to easily switch between different configurations.                       |
| **13. How do you use Spring Boot for logging?**                                  | Spring Boot provides built-in support for logging via `Spring Boot Starter Logging`, which uses `Logback` by default. You can customize logging in `application.properties` by setting logging levels and log file locations.                                                                                                            |
| **14. How do you run a Spring Boot application?**                                | A Spring Boot application can be run by executing the `main()` method annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`. You can run it as a Java application using an IDE or from the command line using `mvn spring-boot:run` or `gradle bootRun`.                                                                                           |
| **15. What is Spring Boot DevTools?**                                             | Spring Boot DevTools is a development-time tool that provides features like automatic restart, live reload, and enhanced debugging support.

| **16. What is the difference between `@Controller` and `@RestController`?**      | `@Controller` is used for handling web requests and returning views in traditional Spring MVC. `@RestController` is a combination of `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`, and it is used to create RESTful web services where the responses are returned as JSON or XML.                                                      |
| **17. What is the purpose of `@RequestMapping` in Spring Boot?**                 | `@RequestMapping` is used to map HTTP requests to handler methods of MVC and REST controllers. It can be used with different HTTP methods such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.                                                                                                                               |
| **18. How can you configure the Spring Boot application to use an embedded server other than Tomcat?** | You can configure Spring Boot to use a different embedded server (e.g., Jetty, Undertow) by including the corresponding dependency (`spring-boot-starter-jetty` or `spring-boot-starter-undertow`) in your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file. Also, configure it in `application.properties`.                                 |
| **19. What is Spring Boot’s default embedded database?**                         | Spring Boot uses an embedded H2 database by default when the `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` dependency is included and no other database configurations are provided.                                                                                                                                         |
| **20. What is the use of `@Configuration` annotation in Spring Boot?**           | `@Configuration` is used to define configuration classes in Spring. These classes contain bean definitions and configuration settings. It is often used along with `@Bean` methods to declare beans that are part of the application context.                                                                              |
| **21. What is Spring Boot’s auto-configuration mechanism?**                     | Auto-configuration is a feature in Spring Boot that automatically configures Spring beans based on the dependencies in the classpath. It attempts to auto-configure beans and setup the application with sensible defaults based on the application's environment.                                                                |
| **22. What are `@Bean` and `@Configuration` used for in Spring Boot?**            | `@Bean` is used to define beans in a configuration class marked with `@Configuration`. It provides a way to explicitly declare beans that will be managed by the Spring container. `@Configuration` is used to declare configuration classes.                                                                         |
| **23. What is Spring Boot’s dependency injection?**                              | Dependency Injection (DI) in Spring Boot is the process where the Spring framework automatically provides the required dependencies (services, repositories, etc.) to classes instead of having to create them manually. DI is achieved using annotations like `@Autowired`, `@Inject`, and `@Resource`.  |
| **24. What are Spring Boot’s `@Value` annotations used for?**                    | `@Value` is used to inject values from `application.properties` or `application.yml` into Spring beans. You can use it to inject primitive values, environment variables, and property values.                                                                                                                                |
| **25. How does Spring Boot handle database connections?**                        | Spring Boot handles database connections by auto-configuring a `DataSource` bean based on the project dependencies like H2, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc. You configure the database connection properties (e.g., URL, username, password) in `application.properties` or `application.yml`.                      |
| **26. How do you enable Spring Boot’s health checks?**                           | Spring Boot provides actuator endpoints for health checks. You can enable health checks by including the `spring-boot-starter-actuator` dependency and configuring the necessary settings in `application.properties`. The `/actuator/health` endpoint provides application health status.                        |
| **27. What is the role of Spring Boot’s `@Service` annotation?**                | `@Service` is used to mark a service class in Spring. It is a specialized form of the `@Component` annotation, and it indicates that the class holds business logic and is meant for service-related functionality.                                                                                                 |
| **28. What is `@Autowired` in Spring Boot?**                                    | `@Autowired` is used to inject dependencies automatically into Spring-managed beans. It eliminates the need to manually instantiate and set up dependencies by letting Spring handle the injection process.                                                                                                        |
| **29. What is the purpose of `@RestController` in Spring Boot?**                 | `@RestController` is used to create RESTful web services in Spring Boot. It combines `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`, automatically serializing the return object to JSON or XML format, and sending it as the response body.                                                                                    |
| **30. How can you test a Spring Boot application?**                              | Spring Boot applications can be tested using `@SpringBootTest` for integration tests, `@WebMvcTest` for web layer testing, and `@MockBean` for mocking beans. Testing can also be done using JUnit 5 or 4 and other test utilities provided by Spring.                                                               |
| **31. What is Spring Data JPA in Spring Boot?**                                  | Spring Data JPA is a module in Spring Boot that simplifies database interaction with JPA (Java Persistence API). It provides repositories and CRUD operations, allowing developers to interact with relational databases with less boilerplate code.                                                              |
| **32. How do you create a repository in Spring Boot?**                           | A repository in Spring Boot can be created by extending the `JpaRepository` or `CrudRepository` interface and annotating it with `@Repository`. Spring Data JPA will automatically implement the repository.                                                                                                         |
| **33. What is the purpose of `@Entity` annotation in Spring Boot?**              | The `@Entity` annotation is used to mark a class as a JPA entity that is mapped to a database table. Each instance of the class corresponds to a row in the table, and the fields in the class represent the columns in the table.                                                                               |
| **34. What is Spring Boot’s `@RequestMapping` annotation used for?**             | `@RequestMapping` is used to map HTTP requests to handler methods in Spring MVC controllers. It can be used with different HTTP methods like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` to define the type of request the method handles.                                                                                   |
| **35. How can you customize Spring Boot error messages?**                        | Error messages in Spring Boot can be customized by overriding the default `ErrorController` or by defining custom exception handlers using `@ControllerAdvice`. You can also configure custom error pages using `application.properties`.                                                               |
| **36. What is Spring Boot’s profile-specific configuration?**                    | Spring Boot allows you to have profile-specific configurations by using `application-{profile}.properties`. This allows different configuration values for different environments, like `application-dev.properties` for development and `application-prod.properties` for production.                     |
| **37. What is `@PostConstruct` annotation in Spring Boot?**                     | The `@PostConstruct` annotation is used to define methods that should be executed after the bean is initialized. It is commonly used to perform initialization tasks once the bean has been fully constructed and injected with dependencies.                                                                 |
| **38. What are Spring Boot starter projects?**                                   | Spring Boot starter projects are a set of pre-configured dependencies that help developers get started quickly. Examples include `spring-boot-starter-web`, `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`, `spring-boot-starter-security`, etc.                                                                         |
| **39. What is the difference between `@Component`, `@Service`, and `@Repository`?** | `@Component` is a general-purpose annotation for Spring beans. `@Service` is used for service classes that contain business logic, while `@Repository` is used for DAO (Data Access Object) classes. These annotations all mark a class as a Spring bean, but with different roles.                             |
| **40. What is Spring Boot’s `@ConfigurationProperties` annotation used for?**    | The `@ConfigurationProperties` annotation is used to bind external properties (e.g., from `application.properties` or `application.yml`) to Java bean properties. It allows you to easily load and access configuration values in your Spring Boot application.                                        |

| **96. How do you handle transactions in Spring Boot?**                           | Transactions in Spring Boot are handled using `@Transactional` annotation. It can be applied to a method or class to ensure that a transaction is started before the method execution and committed or rolled back after the method finishes.                                                                                  |
| **97. What is Spring Boot’s `@Transactional` annotation used for?**             | The `@Transactional` annotation is used to define the scope of a transaction. It ensures that the methods executed within the annotated class or method are part of a single transaction, and the transaction is committed or rolled back based on the method’s outcome.                                                |
| **98. How do you configure Spring Boot to use multiple languages (i18n)?**      | To configure i18n in Spring Boot, you can define message properties files (e.g., `messages.properties`, `messages_en.properties`, `messages_fr.properties`) and use `@MessageSource` to load the messages. You can set the default locale and enable locale resolution through `LocaleResolver`.                          |

| **151. How do you add custom headers to responses in Spring Boot?**              | Custom headers can be added to responses by using `ResponseEntity` in a controller method. You can use the `HttpHeaders` class to set custom headers and then return the `ResponseEntity` with the headers and body. Example: `return new ResponseEntity<>(body, headers, HttpStatus.OK);`.                           |
| **152. What is the `@Repository` annotation in Spring Boot?**                   | `@Repository` is a specialization of `@Component` that is used to define DAO (Data Access Object) classes in Spring. It is typically applied to classes that perform database operations. It also enables automatic exception translation for persistence exceptions.                                             |
| **153. How can you configure multiple data sources in Spring Boot?**             | To configure multiple data sources, you need to define multiple `DataSource` beans, each with its own properties (e.g., connection URL, username, password). You can use `@Primary` to specify which `DataSource` is the default one, and use `@Qualifier` to inject the desired `DataSource` when needed. |
| **154. How do you create custom Spring Boot annotations?**                       | Custom Spring Boot annotations can be created by defining a new annotation and then implementing the functionality associated with it, typically via an Aspect (`@Aspect`) for cross-cutting concerns or using it in custom configuration classes. The annotation should also be annotated with `@Retention` and `@Target`. |
| **155. How do you handle Spring Boot startup errors?**                           | Startup errors in Spring Boot are often logged to the console, and you can configure logging level to `ERROR` or `DEBUG` for more detailed output. You can also implement custom error pages using `@ControllerAdvice` to handle specific exceptions that may occur during application startup.                         |
| **156. What is the difference between `@RequestParam` and `@PathVariable`?**     | `@RequestParam` is used to bind query parameters from the URL, while `@PathVariable` is used to bind values from URI template variables. For example, `/users/{id}` can use `@PathVariable` to extract the value of `{id}`, while `/users?id=1` uses `@RequestParam` to get the value of `id`.                         |
| **157. How do you create a custom filter for a Spring Boot application?**        | To create a custom filter, you need to implement the `javax.servlet.Filter` interface and override the `doFilter` method. You can then register the filter as a Spring bean using `FilterRegistrationBean` in a configuration class. The filter will be invoked for each HTTP request.                                  |
| **158. How do you use Spring Boot with NoSQL databases like MongoDB or Cassandra?** | Spring Boot supports NoSQL databases by providing specific starter dependencies like `spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb` for MongoDB or `spring-boot-starter-data-cassandra` for Cassandra. You can configure connection properties in `application.properties` and use Spring Data repositories for querying. |
| **159. How do you handle Spring Boot database migrations?**                      | Database migrations in Spring Boot can be managed using tools like `Flyway` or `Liquibase`. You need to add the respective dependency (`flyway-core` or `liquibase-core`) to your project and configure the migration scripts in `db/migration`. These tools will automatically handle schema updates on startup. |
| **160. How do you configure Spring Boot to connect to an external API?**         | Spring Boot can connect to external APIs using `RestTemplate` or `WebClient`. You need to configure an instance of `RestTemplate` or `WebClient` and then inject it into your service classes to make HTTP requests to the external APIs. For WebClient, add the dependency `spring-boot-starter-webflux`.                |
| **161. How do you implement transaction management in Spring Boot?**             | Spring Boot uses `@Transactional` to manage transactions. It ensures that a set of operations within a method are executed within a single transaction. You can apply `@Transactional` at the method or class level, and Spring will handle commit/rollback automatically.                                         |
| **162. What are `@EnableScheduling` and `@Scheduled` used for in Spring Boot?**  | `@EnableScheduling` is used to enable support for scheduled tasks in Spring Boot, while `@Scheduled` is used to define methods that should be executed at fixed intervals or according to a cron expression. This is commonly used for background tasks like sending emails or periodic data cleanup.                   |
| **163. How do you use Spring Boot’s `@ComponentScan` annotation?**               | `@ComponentScan` is used to specify the base packages to scan for Spring components (beans). It is typically used in the main class of a Spring Boot application or in a configuration class to scan specific packages for components like `@Service`, `@Controller`, and `@Repository`.                                   |
| **164. How do you secure REST APIs in Spring Boot?**                             | REST APIs in Spring Boot can be secured using Spring Security. You can configure authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth2) and authorization rules (e.g., role-based access) for the endpoints using `HttpSecurity`. You can also use `@PreAuthorize` or `@Secured` annotations to specify method-level security.                   |
| **165. How do you implement custom Spring Boot actuators?**                       | Spring Boot Actuator provides built-in endpoints like `/health`, `/metrics`, etc. You can create custom actuator endpoints by implementing `Endpoint` or `AbstractEndpoint` classes and then registering them in your Spring configuration. These custom endpoints can expose application-specific health or status data. |
| **166. How do you define and use custom Spring Boot profiles?**                  | Spring Boot profiles are used to specify different configurations for different environments (e.g., `dev`, `prod`). You can define properties in `application-{profile}.properties` or `application-{profile}.yml`. To activate a profile, use `@Profile` annotation or set the active profile via `spring.profiles.active`. |
| **167. What is Spring Boot’s `@Bean` annotation used for?**                      | `@Bean` is used to define beans in a Spring configuration class. It is a method-level annotation that tells Spring to treat the return value of the method as a bean to be managed by the Spring container. It is an alternative to `@Component`, `@Service`, etc., for manual bean creation.                              |
| **168. How do you use Spring Boot with Apache Kafka?**                           | Spring Boot integrates with Apache Kafka using the `spring-kafka` starter. You can configure Kafka producers and consumers, set properties (e.g., brokers, groupId), and send/receive messages asynchronously using `@KafkaListener` for consumers and `KafkaTemplate` for producers.                                          |
| **169. How do you handle Spring Boot’s application properties encryption?**      | Application properties encryption can be done using Spring Cloud Config or third-party libraries. You can use `@Value` or `@ConfigurationProperties` to inject encrypted values and configure Spring Boot to decrypt these values at runtime using a custom `PropertySource` or `EncryptablePropertySource` bean.               |
| **170. How do you configure Spring Boot to use external authentication providers?** | External authentication can be integrated into Spring Boot using Spring Security. For example, OAuth2 login can be set up with `spring-boot-starter-oauth2-client`, and you can configure authentication with external providers like Google, Facebook, or GitHub by specifying client credentials in `application.properties`. |
| **171. What is Spring Boot's support for `@Cacheable` and caching?**             | `@Cacheable` is used to mark methods whose results should be cached. Spring Boot supports caching through providers like EhCache, Redis, and simple in-memory caches. The caching behavior is configured with annotations and a caching manager, which stores method results in the cache for faster retrieval on subsequent calls. |
| **172. How do you handle and track the version of your Spring Boot application?** | You can handle versioning by using the `maven-release-plugin` or `gradle-release-plugin` to define application versions. You can also expose the version number via Spring Boot Actuator’s `/info` endpoint, which can be configured to return build and version information from `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`.                    |
| **173. How do you manage multiple microservices with Spring Boot?**              | You can manage multiple microservices with Spring Boot using Spring Cloud for service discovery (e.g., with Eureka), API gateways (e.g., with Spring Cloud Gateway), configuration management (e.g., with Spring Cloud Config), and distributed tracing (e.g., with Spring Cloud Sleuth).                            |
| **174. How do you integrate Spring Boot with a message broker like RabbitMQ?**   | Spring Boot integrates with RabbitMQ through `spring-boot-starter-amqp`. You can configure connection details in `application.properties` and define message producers and listeners using `RabbitTemplate` and `@RabbitListener`. RabbitMQ can be used for pub/sub or point-to-point messaging patterns.                      |
| **175. How do you create a Spring Boot CLI application?**                        | Spring Boot CLI (Command-Line Interface) allows you to run Groovy scripts to define and run Spring Boot applications. You can install Spring Boot CLI and use `spring run` to execute `.groovy` files, which can contain Spring Boot beans, controllers, and configurations.                                            |
| **176. What is the `spring-boot-devtools` dependency used for?**                 | `spring-boot-devtools` provides features like automatic application restarts, live reload, and enhanced debugging during development.

| **177. What is Spring Boot's `@RequestMapping` annotation used for?**            | `@RequestMapping` is used to map HTTP requests to handler methods of MVC and REST controllers. It allows you to specify HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and path patterns. For example: `@RequestMapping("/users")` will map `/users` endpoint to the method.                                                        |
| **178. What is the purpose of `@Component` annotation in Spring Boot?**          | The `@Component` annotation is used to mark a class as a Spring-managed bean. When a class is annotated with `@Component`, Spring will automatically detect it and register it as a bean during classpath scanning. Other specialized annotations like `@Service` and `@Repository` are derived from `@Component`.      |
| **179. How do you perform validation in Spring Boot?**                           | Spring Boot provides validation support using JSR-303/JSR-380 annotations like `@NotNull`, `@Size`, `@Email`, `@Min`, `@Max`, etc., on model attributes. The validation can be triggered by `@Valid` or `@Validated` on the method parameter in controllers. It also integrates with Hibernate Validator for advanced features. |
| **180. How do you use Spring Boot with Apache Camel?**                           | To integrate Spring Boot with Apache Camel, you can add the `spring-boot-starter-camel` dependency. Camel routes can be configured using Java DSL or Spring XML, and they can be easily deployed as Spring Boot applications. You can use Camel’s endpoints to send and receive messages from different sources.          |
| **181. What is Spring Boot's `@EnableAutoConfiguration` annotation used for?**   | `@EnableAutoConfiguration` enables Spring Boot’s automatic configuration feature. It automatically configures Spring beans and components based on the classes available in the classpath. It eliminates the need for XML configuration or manual bean creation, allowing for auto-configuration based on the environment. |
| **182. How do you configure Spring Boot to run on a different port?**            | You can configure the port for Spring Boot’s embedded server (e.g., Tomcat) in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file. For example: `server.port=8081` will set the port to 8081 instead of the default 8080. You can also set the port programmatically using `SpringApplication.setDefaultProperties`. |
| **183. How do you enable Spring Boot to log SQL queries?**                       | To log SQL queries, you can enable logging for Hibernate SQL and JDBC statements. In `application.properties`, set `spring.jpa.show-sql=true` to log SQL queries. Additionally, you can set `logging.level.org.hibernate.SQL=DEBUG` to log SQL queries and `logging.level.org.hibernate.type.descriptor.sql=TRACE` for parameter values. |
| **184. How do you use Spring Boot with Thymeleaf?**                              | Spring Boot integrates with Thymeleaf by adding the `spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf` dependency. You can create HTML templates using Thymeleaf syntax, and Spring Boot will automatically configure the `TemplateEngine`. Place your templates in `src/main/resources/templates` and use `@Controller` to return views.            |
| **185. What is the role of `@EnableWebSecurity` in Spring Security?**            | `@EnableWebSecurity` is used to enable Spring Security's web security configuration. It activates Spring Security's default security setup for protecting web applications. It can also be extended by creating custom configuration classes that override default security settings like authentication and authorization rules. |
| **186. What is the difference between `@EnableAutoConfiguration` and `@ComponentScan`?** | `@EnableAutoConfiguration` automatically configures Spring beans based on the dependencies in the classpath, while `@ComponentScan` is used to scan specific packages for Spring components (like `@Service`, `@Repository`, etc.). `@EnableAutoConfiguration` is typically used in the main application class, and `@ComponentScan` can be used for package-specific bean scanning. |
| **187. How do you secure Spring Boot APIs using JWT (JSON Web Token)?**           | To secure Spring Boot APIs using JWT, you need to configure Spring Security to accept JWT tokens for authentication. You can create a filter that extracts the JWT token from the request header, validates it, and sets the user authentication in the `SecurityContextHolder`. You can also use `@PreAuthorize` or `@Secured` for authorization. |
| **188. How do you use Spring Boot’s `@RequestMapping` for RESTful APIs?**        | `@RequestMapping` is used to handle HTTP requests in RESTful APIs. You can map specific HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) to controller methods, specify request paths, and handle request parameters. For example: `@RequestMapping(value = "/users", method = RequestMethod.GET)` will map to GET requests on `/users`. |
| **189. What is Spring Boot’s support for Swagger UI?**                           | Spring Boot supports Swagger UI through the `springfox-swagger2` and `springfox-swagger-ui` dependencies. You can configure Swagger documentation for your REST APIs using `@Api` and `@ApiOperation` annotations, and the generated Swagger UI can be accessed at `/swagger-ui.html` to explore and test the API.                |
| **190. How do you connect Spring Boot with Redis?**                             | To connect Spring Boot with Redis, add the `spring-boot-starter-data-redis` dependency. You can then configure Redis connection details in `application.properties`. You can use `RedisTemplate` to interact with Redis or `@Cacheable` for caching purposes, which will leverage Redis as the cache provider.               |
| **191. What is Spring Boot’s support for testing with `@WebMvcTest`?**           | `@WebMvcTest` is used for testing Spring MVC controllers in isolation. It only loads Spring MVC configuration and mocks the services and repositories. This annotation is useful for testing web layers without initializing the full Spring context. It allows you to test controllers and HTTP responses using mock setups.            |
| **192. How do you monitor Spring Boot applications in production?**             | Spring Boot applications can be monitored in production using Spring Boot Actuator. You can expose various metrics and health check endpoints like `/actuator/health`, `/actuator/metrics`, `/actuator/trace`. Additionally, tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK Stack can be integrated for centralized logging and monitoring. |
| **193. How do you define custom Spring Boot properties?**                        | Custom properties can be defined in `application.properties` or `application.yml`. You can use the `@Value` annotation to inject specific property values into beans or use `@ConfigurationProperties` to bind complex groups of properties to a Java object. Additionally, you can define profiles like `application-dev.properties`.   |
| **194. How can you profile beans in Spring Boot?**                              | Beans can be profiled using the `@Profile` annotation in Spring Boot. By assigning a profile to a bean, you ensure that the bean is only loaded in specific profiles (e.g., `@Profile("dev")` for development). You can specify active profiles in `application.properties` using `spring.profiles.active=dev`.                        |
| **195. What is the purpose of `spring-boot-starter-web` in Spring Boot?**        | The `spring-boot-starter-web` is a starter dependency that includes the necessary components for building web applications using Spring MVC. It includes libraries for RESTful web services (Jackson, Tomcat, etc.) and enables controllers, views, and HTTP request handling for web applications.                               |
| **196. How do you handle retries in Spring Boot?**                              | Spring Boot supports retries using Spring Retry. You can use the `@Retryable` annotation on methods to configure retries with custom retry policies. You can also configure retries globally using `@EnableRetry` in a configuration class, setting the retry parameters like the number of attempts, backoff time, etc.         |
| **197. How do you enable Spring Boot to run as a Docker container?**            | To run a Spring Boot application as a Docker container, you need to create a `Dockerfile` that defines how to build the image. The Dockerfile should contain a command to copy the JAR file into the container and run it with `java -jar`. After building the Docker image, you can run it using `docker run` with port mapping.         |
| **198. What is the role of `@ResponseBody` in Spring Boot?**                    | `@ResponseBody` is used to indicate that the return value of a controller method should be bound to the web response body. It is typically used in REST APIs to return data in formats like JSON or XML, as opposed to returning a view name. It can also be used alongside `@RequestBody` for incoming request payloads.              |
| **199. How do you enable custom error handling in Spring Boot?**                | Custom error handling in Spring Boot can be achieved by implementing an `@ControllerAdvice` class with `@ExceptionHandler` methods to catch exceptions and return appropriate responses. You can also define custom error pages using `ErrorController` or by creating custom error view templates like `error-404.html`.                  |
| **200. How do you configure Spring Boot for internationalization (i18n)?**       | Spring Boot supports internationalization by configuring message sources with `MessageSource` bean. You can place messages in properties files (e.g., `messages.properties`, `messages_en.properties`, `messages_fr.properties`) and use `@Value` or `@Autowired` to inject translated messages into your controllers or services. |
