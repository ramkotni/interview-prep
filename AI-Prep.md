Generative AI, Deep learning

basic nueral networks ...


image classification ..regression problem ..

Gen AI ... expecting output as same as input ...

if i input image data and output will be image data ...

NLP - making machine understand Text

Deep learning - video, audio, tabular data, text, graph -- DL is techninque

create architecture or function around it, 

transformers is model, GNN for graph model ...

making understanding mache image ..

how to solve 

computer vision .. to make machine understand images ... Deep learning techniques to understand the images.

why do we use Machine learning what are its use cases?
we basically use 
deep learning models, llms
ML is used to predict ... pricing of the house, all the features in ... 
AI - ML - DL
Deep learning ...
features like images, text ... both ML and DL are subset of artificial intelligence ..

ML came into ..if the email is spam or not , if we have to say millions of data set, certain complex features ..the models
they demand structured data ... we have to perfrom normalization, lot of human intervention ... in case of DL, we need to use
Neural networks ... extracting the pixels from the image ... neural networks will do automatically ... 

ML need demand human intervention and they require lot of feature engineering ...

DL does not need any human intervention ..

ML will be difficult classify image ..

Neural network ... it concept taken from Human nervous system ...
