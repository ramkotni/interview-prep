Hi, I'm Ram Kotni. I have 16 years of experience in Java Fullstack technologies, primarily working as a backend developer utilizing core Java concepts, including JDK 8, JDK 11, and executor frameworks. I have extensive experience with frameworks such as Spring, Hibernate, and Spring Boot. I've both exposed and consumed downstream REST endpoints using REST templates and Feign clients, and I've worked on microservices from scratch as well as existing ones, employing various patterns like Saga, Discovery, API Gateway, and Circuit Breaker.

I monitor application logs using Splunk dashboards and track memory spikes with Grafana and AppDynamics dashboards. Deployment is managed through Jenkins CI/CD pipelines, and I'm proficient in writing Jenkins scripts. I also maintain AWS EC2 instances and am well-versed in using S3 buckets, IAM policies, and CloudWatch.

As a developer, I ensure the code is testable by writing JUnit test cases using the Mockito framework, aiming for 90% code coverage with SonarQube plugins. I handle authentication and authorization of user requests using JSON Web Tokens and AWS IAM policies. I've worked extensively with Kafka as both a consumer and producer, managing different Kafka topics, consumer groups, partition offsets, and configurations.

My database experience includes Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, and DynamoDB. On the frontend, I have experience with JavaScript, Angular, HTML, CSS, and some exposure to React.js.

Roles and Responsibilities:
Follow agile methodologies with two-week sprints, participating in all agile ceremonies such as planning, review, refinement, retrospective, and daily stand-up meetings.
Prepare quarterly roadmaps during JAD(Joint Application Development) sessions, prioritize user stories, and work on them accordingly.
Review pull requests from team members, manage deployments, and provide demos to stakeholders in UAT environments.
Deploy to different environments, including Linux.
Write JUnit test cases using the Mockito framework and maintain 85% test coverage with JaCoCo and SonarQube plugins.
Oversee and support offshore team members.
These are the technologies and methodologies I have worked with throughout my career.

Introduction:

"Hi, I'm Ram Kotni, and I have 16 years of experience working in Java Full Stack technologies, with a primary focus on backend development. My expertise centers around core Java concepts, including JDK 8, JDK 11, JDK17 and Java Executor frameworks, which I've used to build efficient, scalable applications."

Professional Summary:

"I’m highly skilled in using frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, and Spring Boot, and have worked on RESTful services extensively, using REST templates and Feign clients to both expose and consume downstream endpoints. In my previous role, I had the opportunity to design microservices from the ground up and enhance existing services, applying key design patterns such as Saga, Discovery, API Gateway, and Circuit Breaker."

Technical Skills:

"My work often involves monitoring application logs through Splunk and tracking memory with Grafana and AppDynamics. I handle deployments via Jenkins CI/CD pipelines and write Jenkins scripts as needed. I also manage AWS resources like EC2, S3, IAM, and CloudWatch, ensuring secure and optimized cloud environments. Additionally, I maintain high code quality, using tools like JUnit with Mockito for testing, aiming for robust coverage with SonarQube."

Database and Frontend Experience:

"I have a solid database background, with experience across Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, and DynamoDB. On the frontend, I’ve worked with JavaScript, Angular, HTML, CSS, and some React.js, giving me a full-stack perspective."

Project Highlight:

"One of my notable projects was at Amazon Robotics, where I worked on a system to improve the efficiency and accuracy of delivery agents through real-time data. This involved using Java 17 and Spring Boot to process data streams and AWS for scalable storage and processing. The project helped me combine my backend expertise with AWS cloud and DevOps practices to make an impact in real-world logistics."

Closing:

"I’m looking forward to bringing my technical experience and collaborative approach to this role and am excited to discuss how my background aligns with the team’s objectives."

Interviewer: Hi Ram, can you introduce yourself and tell us a bit about your background?

Ram Kotni: Absolutely! I’m Ram Kotni, and I bring 16 years of experience in IT, where I’ve worn many hats – from backend development to leading and architecting full-stack solutions. Over the years, I’ve developed a strong foundation in Spring Boot, Hibernate, and the Spring Framework, with significant experience designing and building microservices from the ground up using patterns like Circuit Breaker, Saga, and Discovery.

In terms of my daily development activities, I’ve always been hands-on. I’m involved in everything from writing clean, efficient code to designing architecture. I typically start my day by reviewing the previous day’s work, ensuring all tasks are aligned with sprint goals, and addressing any blockers that may have come up. I then dive into writing RESTful microservices, building out APIs, and ensuring proper integration with frontend systems and external services.

As a lead developer and architect, I also play a key role in designing system architecture, ensuring scalability, fault tolerance, and security of the solutions we develop. I also mentor junior developers, conduct code reviews, and work with cross-functional teams to implement solutions that align with business requirements. Agile ceremonies are a big part of my day too, where I actively participate in sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and review meetings, ensuring timely delivery and that the team is aligned with project objectives.

Interviewer: That’s great! Can you share more about your specific role in the projects you’ve worked on and what you did on a daily basis?

Ram Kotni: Absolutely! In my current role, I lead the Amazon Delivery Tracking System project, a full-stack Java application for real-time delivery tracking.

On a daily basis, my tasks include:

Backend development: I work with Spring Boot to design and develop microservices that handle core features like delivery status, real-time updates, and user management.
Frontend collaboration: I work closely with frontend developers, ensuring that the React interfaces we build communicate seamlessly with the backend.
AWS management: I deploy the microservices to EC2, manage S3 storage, and set up CloudWatch for monitoring.
Security implementation: I ensure JWT authentication is implemented for secure access.
Quality control: I write JUnit tests to ensure both functional and non-functional requirements are met before deployment.
As a lead developer, I ensure the code is following best practices, and as an architect, I ensure that the architecture is scalable and fault-tolerant.

Previously, at Biogen, I led the development of a full-stack Java application to support their research in neurological diseases like MS and Alzheimer's. My daily activities included:

Microservice development: I built RESTful APIs using Spring Boot to manage clinical trial data, patient records, and drug development data.
Database design: I designed and optimized databases using Oracle and Hibernate to handle large volumes of clinical and medical data.
Frontend development: I worked with React to develop dashboards and interfaces for real-time access to patient and clinical trial data.
Collaboration and mentoring: I mentored junior developers and worked with cross-functional teams to integrate the application with AWS services (EC2, S3, IAM, CloudWatch).
Security: I implemented JWT authentication and role-based access controls to ensure compliance with HIPAA and other regulatory standards.
Agile methodology: I led the Agile ceremonies, worked on sprint planning, and ensured the team stayed aligned with sprint goals.
I also regularly deployed code to UAT, demonstrated the new features to stakeholders, and ensured everything was properly tested using JUnit before going live.
