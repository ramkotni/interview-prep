Hi, myself ramkotni I have 16 years of hands on experience in PLM Technologies and Java Full Stack technologies, used core Java concepts JDK 8, JDK 11 and executor frameworks 
and extensively worked on different frameworks like spring hibernate, Spring Boot, 

I have exposed and consumed downstream REST endpoints using REST templates and feign clients And also worked on micro services from the scratch and existing microservices also by using the different patterns like saga pattern, Discovery pattern, API gateway pattern and circuit breaker patterns.

And we used to monitor the application logs using the Splunk dashboards and we monitor memory spikes using Grafana and Appdynamics dashboards.

And we use to deploy through Jenkins CI CD pipelines and have good exposure to write the Jenkins script file. 

And we used to maintain the AWS EC2 instances. And also I am well versed with the s3 buckets, IAM policies and CloudWatch as well These are the services which I have used in AWS 

and we used to write the Junit test cases as a developer we must and should make sure the whatever the code we have been written it should be testable using Mockito framework we are writing Junit test cases. 

And we are ensuring that 90% of code coverage by using sonarqube plugins.

And we use to authenticate and authorize the user request using the JSON web tokens and AWS IAM policies 

and I acted as a Kafka Consumer for the different Kafka topics and also have produced different messages as well and also good exposure on the Configuring the different consumer groups and partitions offset and these kinds of the configurations.

worked Oracle, Postgresql and MySQL RDBMS databases and also noSQL databases like MongoDB, Cassandra and DynamoDB.

And I worked on the UI technologies as well using the JavaScript Angular and HTML and CSS, and also have good exposure on React js as well. 

And these are the tech stack which I had worked on it. 

Coming to my roles and responsibilities:

Architect solutions to simplify business processes. Build simple, scalable, robust, secure applications.
As a Architect my role involved design the overall structure of software solutions making high level design decision ensuring the system meets functional and nonfunctional requirements
I collaborate with stakeholders, development team and other architects and define architecture patterns.


We were following agile methodologies. It's about two weeks of sprint. And I was involving all agile ceremonies like planning, review , refinement and retrospective and DSM meeting.
Usually we will have zad session there will prepare roadmap for the entire quarter.based on the priority will pick the user stories and will work on it.

I use to review the other folks PRs I used to take care of all the deployments and giving demo to the stakeholders in the UAT environments and I have good exposure on deploying to the different environments using the Linux environment as well.
after that will write junit test cases using Mockito framework and we are maintaining 85% of test coverage to ensure that we are using jacoco and SonarQube plugins.

I use to take care about the offshore team members also.
