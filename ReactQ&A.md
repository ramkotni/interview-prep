Top Interview Questions and Answers on React JS
Here are some common interview questions related to React JS along with answers:

1. What is React?
Answer:
React is a popular open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications where you need a fast, interactive user experience. It was developed by Facebook and allows developers to build large-scale applications with data that changes over time. React is focused on building reusable UI components, making the process of developing dynamic applications efficient.

Key Concepts:

Component-based architecture: React allows developers to break down the UI into reusable components.
Declarative UI: React uses a declarative syntax, meaning the UI updates automatically when the data changes.
Virtual DOM: React uses the Virtual DOM to improve performance by only updating the real DOM when necessary.
2. What is JSX?
Answer:
JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used with React. It looks similar to HTML, but it is more powerful because you can embed JavaScript expressions inside curly braces {}.

Example:

javascript
Copy
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
React components are typically written in JSX because it allows you to write components in a format that looks like HTML but is processed by JavaScript.

3. What is a React Component?
Answer:
A React component is a reusable, self-contained unit that encapsulates the logic and UI of a part of an application. Components in React can be either class components or functional components.

Class Components: These are ES6 classes that extend React.Component and must implement a render method that returns JSX.
Functional Components: These are simpler and just use functions that return JSX. With the introduction of Hooks, functional components have become the preferred way of creating components in React.
Example:

javascript
Copy
// Functional Component
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
4. What is the difference between state and props in React?
Answer:

Props: Short for properties, props are read-only values that are passed from a parent component to a child component. Props allow data to flow down the component tree.

Example:

javascript
Copy
function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
State: State is a local data storage that is specific to the component and can change over time. Components that maintain a state can update it, and React automatically re-renders the component whenever the state changes.

Example:

javascript
Copy
class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }

  increment = () => {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>{this.state.count}</p>
        <button onClick={this.increment}>Increment</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
5. What are Hooks in React?
Answer:
Hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components. Before React Hooks were introduced, state management and lifecycle methods were only available in class components. With hooks, you can use state (useState), side effects (useEffect), and other features in functional components.

Common Hooks:

useState: Allows you to add state to a functional component.
useEffect: Allows you to perform side effects in your component, such as fetching data or updating the DOM.
useContext: Allows you to access context values.
Example with useState:

javascript
Copy
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // useState returns a pair: state and setter function

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
6. What is the Virtual DOM in React?
Answer:
The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a lightweight in-memory representation of the real DOM elements. React uses it to improve the performance of web applications.

When an event occurs, React first updates the Virtual DOM and compares it with the previous version of the Virtual DOM. It then determines the minimal number of changes required to update the real DOM. This is known as Reconciliation and helps improve performance by reducing the number of direct DOM manipulations.

7. What are controlled components in React?
Answer:
A controlled component is an input element whose value is controlled by the React state. When an input element is controlled, its value is tied to the state of the component, and every change to the input is managed via the component's state.

Example:

javascript
Copy
function ControlledInput() {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState("");

  const handleChange = (event) => {
    setInputValue(event.target.value);
  };

  return <input type="text" value={inputValue} onChange={handleChange} />;
}
8. What is the purpose of key in React lists?
Answer:
In React, when rendering a list of elements, each child in the list should have a unique key prop. The key helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed, which improves the performance of rendering updates.

Example:

javascript
Copy
const listItems = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry'];

function FruitList() {
  return (
    <ul>
      {listItems.map((item, index) => (
        <li key={index}>{item}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
9. What is React Router?
Answer:
React Router is a library used to handle navigation in React applications. It allows you to map components to different URL paths, enabling you to create single-page applications with dynamic, client-side routing.

Example:

javascript
Copy
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from "react-router-dom";

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Switch>
        <Route path="/home" component={Home} />
        <Route path="/about" component={About} />
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
}
10. Explain the concept of "lifting state up" in React.
Answer:
"Lifting state up" refers to the process of moving the state from a child component to a parent component so that it can be shared by multiple child components. When multiple components need to access the same state, it's a good idea to lift the state to their common ancestor.

Example:

javascript
Copy
function ParentComponent() {
  const [sharedState, setSharedState] = useState("Some data");

  return (
    <div>
      <ChildComponent1 sharedState={sharedState} />
      <ChildComponent2 setSharedState={setSharedState} />
    </div>
  );
}
React Components: A High-Level Explanation
React is centered around the concept of components, which are reusable building blocks of a React application. These components can be either functional or class-based, although functional components are more commonly used with the introduction of Hooks.

Types of React Components:

Functional Components: These are simpler components written as JavaScript functions. With the introduction of Hooks, functional components can manage state, side effects, and other functionalities.

Example:

javascript
Copy
function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
Class Components: These are ES6 classes that extend React.Component. They can have state and lifecycle methods, but in modern React, most components are now written as functional components using Hooks.

Example:

javascript
Copy
class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
Components interact with each other via props (read-only data passed from parent to child) and state (local data that can change and trigger re-renders). Components can also have lifecycle methods, though with hooks, state and side effects can now be managed inside functional components.

React Component Lifecycle (for Class Components):

Mounting: Component is created and inserted into the DOM.
Updating: Component is re-rendered due to changes in state or props.
Unmounting: Component is removed from the DOM.
Functional components with hooks allow developers to manage state (useState), side effects (useEffect), context (useContext), and more without needing to write a class component.

Conclusion
React is a powerful and flexible JavaScript library for building modern, high-performance web applications. With concepts such as components, state management, virtual DOM, and React hooks, React simplifies building scalable, maintainable user interfaces. It is widely adopted in the industry and continues to evolve, keeping pace with modern web development trends.


In React, state and props are two key concepts used to manage data and control how a component behaves and renders. Here's a breakdown of the differences:

State
Definition:

State is a local, mutable data storage that a component controls and uses to render dynamic content.
It represents the internal data of a component and can change over time, usually in response to user interactions or other events.
Usage:

Used to track changes or manage the component's behavior (e.g., toggling a dropdown, updating a form field).
Changes in state trigger a re-render of the component.
Mutability:

State is mutable but can only be modified using the setState function (in class components) or the useState hook (in functional components).
Scope:

State is local to the component and cannot be accessed directly by child components (unless passed as props).
Example:

jsx
Copy
Edit
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Count: {count}</p>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
        </div>
    );
}
Props
Definition:

Props (short for properties) are inputs passed from a parent component to a child component.
They are used to configure the child component or pass data down the component tree.
Usage:

Used to pass data, including state or functions, from one component to another.
Props are read-only and cannot be modified by the child component.
Mutability:

Props are immutable; the child component cannot change the props it receives.
Scope:

Props flow unidirectionally (from parent to child). They allow components to be reused with different data.
Example:

jsx
Copy
Edit
function Greeting({ name }) {
    return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}

function App() {
    return <Greeting name="Alice" />;
}
Key Differences
Feature	State	Props
Definition	Managed within the component itself	Passed to a component from its parent
Mutability	Mutable (via setState or hooks)	Immutable
Scope	Local to the component	Passed down the component tree
Use Case	Managing dynamic data or UI	Configuring or passing data to a child component
In summary:

Use state when you need to manage data that changes over time within a component.
Use props when you need to pass data or functions from a parent to a child component.
