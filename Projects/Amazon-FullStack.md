Amazon Robotics, formerly Kiva Systems, is a Massachusetts-based company that manufactures mobile robotic fulfillment systems.It is a subsidiary company of Amazon.com.Amazon Robotics develops and provides a range of robotic systems and solutions that are designed to automate various tasks within Amazon's fulfillment centers. These robots are used for tasks such as moving goods, sorting items, and transporting products within the warehouses. These solutions aim to increase operational efficiency and reduce the time it takes to fulfill customer orders.Amazon Robotics integrates its robotic systems into Amazon's existing fulfillment centers. This involves deploying the robots and integrating them with Amazon's inventory management and order processing systems. The robots work alongside human workers to improve the speed and accuracy of order fulfillment.

Oracle Product lifecycle management is the process of managing the entire lifecycle of a product from its inception through design, development, validation, launch, and sustainment to obsolete. At Amazon Robotics, we have implemented and support the Oracle Agile PLM platform to provide central management of all aspects of Robotics product data like AR Drive Units,AR Drive Stands, Amazon Pegasus, Amazon Xanthus and AR Robo-Stow etc. consisting of a series of Agile integrated solutions.Also enabled Agile Integration services which extend the Agile suite with back-office downstream applications like iHub, ProPlanner, Oracle EBS, DWEEBS and upstream application ORCAD,SolidWork,Creo,Z2Data, Parts Manager etc.

Project Overview
The full-stack application will consist of:

Frontend: React or Angular for the user interface.
Backend: Spring Boot for the server-side logic.
Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL for relational data storage.
We'll use Spring Boot to expose REST APIs that can interact with the frontend, which will present data related to Amazon Robotics, product lifecycle management, Agile PLM, and other integrated systems.

Technology Stack
Frontend: React/Angular, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Spring Boot (Java), JPA (for database interaction)
Database: MySQL or PostgreSQL
API Communication: RESTful services (JSON)
Deployment: Docker for containerization, AWS or any cloud provider for hosting (optional)
System Requirements:
User Authentication: User login and access control for employees, developers, and admins.
Data Management: Managing product lifecycle, robotics solutions, configurations, and integration systems.
Operational Monitoring: Monitoring the health of Agile PLM and integration systems (e.g., IHUB).
Reports and Dashboards: Displaying operational data, robotics data, and ticketing system.
Ticket Management: Create, track, and assign tickets to teams for issues related to Agile PLM or robotic systems.
Steps to Implement the Full-Stack Application
Step 1: Setting Up Spring Boot Backend
Initialize Spring Boot Application:

Use Spring Initializr to generate a new Spring Boot project with dependencies such as:
Spring Web (RESTful services)
Spring Data JPA (Database interaction)
Spring Security (User authentication and authorization)
H2 or MySQL/PostgreSQL (for database)
Database Design:

Define the necessary entities (tables) such as:
RoboticSystems (for different robots like AR Drive Units, Robo-Stow)
ProductLifecycleData (storing product lifecycle stages, such as design, development, validation, etc.)
PLMConfiguration (for Agile PLM configurations)
TicketSystem (tracking issues like IHUB, PROD issues)
IntegrationLogs (for logging integration issues between different systems)
Example of an entity:

java
Copy
@Entity
@Table(name = "robotic_systems")
public class RoboticSystem {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private String model;
    private String functionality;
    private Date deploymentDate;
    // Getters and Setters
}
Repository Layer:

Create repository interfaces for accessing the database.
java
Copy
@Repository
public interface RoboticSystemRepository extends JpaRepository<RoboticSystem, Long> {}
Service Layer:

Implement business logic to manage robotic systems and integrations.
java
Copy
@Service
public class RoboticSystemService {
    @Autowired
    private RoboticSystemRepository roboticSystemRepository;

    public List<RoboticSystem> getAllSystems() {
        return roboticSystemRepository.findAll();
    }
}
Controller Layer:

Expose REST APIs to the frontend.
java
Copy
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/robotics")
public class RoboticSystemController {
    @Autowired
    private RoboticSystemService roboticSystemService;

    @GetMapping("/systems")
    public List<RoboticSystem> getAllSystems() {
        return roboticSystemService.getAllSystems();
    }
}
Security:

Implement basic authentication or JWT-based token security for API access.
Step 2: Frontend Using React/Angular
For React:
Setting Up React Application:

Use create-react-app to set up the frontend project:
bash
Copy
npx create-react-app amazon-robotics
State Management:

Use React hooks for managing states like user authentication and robotic system data.
API Integration:

Use Axios or Fetch API to connect the frontend with Spring Boot backend REST APIs.
javascript
Copy
import axios from 'axios';

const fetchRoboticSystems = async () => {
  const response = await axios.get('/api/robotics/systems');
  setSystems(response.data);
};
Create Components:

Dashboard: Display key metrics (e.g., total robots, system health).
Robotics Management: A page to view and manage robotic systems.
Ticket Management: A page to create and view tickets related to Agile PLM or robotic systems.
Example component for displaying robotic systems:

javascript
Copy
const RoboticsDashboard = () => {
  const [systems, setSystems] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchRoboticSystems();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Robotic Systems</h1>
      <ul>
        {systems.map(system => (
          <li key={system.id}>{system.name} - {system.functionality}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};
For Angular:
Setting Up Angular Application:

Use Angular CLI to set up the project:
bash
Copy
ng new amazon-robotics
Service for API Integration:

Create an Angular service to handle API requests.
typescript
Copy
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class RoboticsService {
  private apiUrl = '/api/robotics/systems';

  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

  getRoboticSystems() {
    return this.http.get<RoboticSystem[]>(this.apiUrl);
  }
}
Component for Robotics Systems:

Use Angular components to display robotic system data.
typescript
Copy
@Component({
  selector: 'app-robotics-dashboard',
  templateUrl: './robotics-dashboard.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./robotics-dashboard.component.css']
})
export class RoboticsDashboardComponent implements OnInit {
  systems: RoboticSystem[];

  constructor(private roboticsService: RoboticsService) {}

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.roboticsService.getRoboticSystems().subscribe(data => {
      this.systems = data;
    });
  }
}
Step 3: Deployment & Containerization
Dockerize the Application: Create Dockerfiles for both frontend and backend services.
CI/CD Pipeline: Use Jenkins, GitLab, or GitHub Actions to automate builds, tests, and deployments.
Cloud Deployment: Deploy your application on AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
Conclusion
This system provides an end-to-end solution for managing robotic systems, product lifecycle management, and integration systems within Amazon Robotics. The application leverages Spring Boot for the backend, React or Angular for the frontend, and a database to store robotic systems and product data. By using RESTful APIs and securing the communication with user authentication, this application can be deployed and scaled to meet operational needs.
