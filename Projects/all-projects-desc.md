Project1 Description: Milestones Rewrite is a project to migrate Legacy Milestones Tool to Agile PLM Environment.PPM Module in Agile has been used to implement this project. The Information Development Milestones Database (Milestones) is used to track documentation project dates, team members, and part numbers. In the previous tool, managers, strategists, and administrators had the ability to edit, add, and remove records. The big change with this Web-based SQL tool is that individual contributors (ICs), who report milestones on a weekly basis, can now mark their milestones directly in the tool. With these “live” updates you won’t have to print paper copies, mark them up, make multiple copies, and deliver them to the teams on Fridays. The database has evolved from an Excel spreadsheet to an Access-based client-server database and now to an SQL-based Web database, which is chartered under PG IT. Issues with the working of the database should be addressed to an Info Dev contact to resolve with the IT person assigned to maintain the database.
Project2 Description: CPG Automation process - Agile is a secure source of record for the server team to store the catalog files and also have corresponding file folder correlation against the releases (part#id). FTP site doesn’t have details corresponding to part information, it has only the catalog files/folder.Agile will also have information w.r.t any revision of files or updates made. In case of any issues post release to FTP, correlation of folder to part & corresponding release is being done in Agile. Previous catalogs may or may not be stored at server team end, since there is not enough infrastructure for the same and any changes done cannot be tracked.Client team follows similar process, except that they do not store revisions of their catalogs since they deal with more number of systems. They prefer over-writing the catalog files, which will be stopped in the new approach recommended, due to the catalog file corruption issues they were facing @ downloads.dell.com

Project Description: AIC Project is Agile–i-Drive Consolidation Software & Block Transition, Currently in the existing system, the hardware information is stored in Agile and the software part numbers are created in Agile and used in the product structure, but the software content files are released and managed in iDrive. Being in two distinct systems, there is no direct relationship maintained between the hardware and software parts. This project will address the requirements of a unified product structure of Hardware and Software parts. This will also enable the change management, release management and reporting processes in a single system. Implemented QueueService Framework for AIC Project. QueueService is a background process like daemon process, which runs continuously as windows service until the service is killed, it’s implemented using multi threading.

Portfolio Reconciliation. Deriv/SERV allows its users to submit derivative transactions to a central matching engine for confirmation and reporting purposes. Once a trade is confirmed (matched on both sides) it creates an accurate, legal, electronic trade (agreement) between the parties



Project Description	: Infomediary (Router) is messaging gateway and transformation application. With Infomediary, it is no longer needed to maintain multiple connectivity portals, such as SWIFT, fax and FTP to communicate with providers. Instead simply send messages to infomediary and infomediary will send these messages to providers. Infomediary is not limited in its message formats. It accepts message format produced by trading application and transforms it into any format required by providers. We can send messages to infomediary via FTP over the internet, MQ with a leased Radianz connection, SWIFT network and also possible to send files via HTTPS. Providers receive messages via fax, email. There are four online web based J2EE applications to see the status of files and messages successfully processed by router.1. InfoMonitor – It monitors and query current and historical message activity in Router.2. Data Manager – Update, add, delete enrichment data. 3. Message View and Repair – Modify trade and cash messages in repair status and access message using account, security, broker and currency code 4. Message Entry – create new messages for infomediary.



Project Description	: Packet 8 - The 8x8 is originator of the Packet8 Broadband Phone Service, VoIP (voice over internet protocol) and videophone communications service providers.
