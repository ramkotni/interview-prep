Creating an end-to-end flow for an Amazon robotics tracking delivery system, integrating it with a full-stack Java application, involves several technologies. The architecture must support fault tolerance, microservices, and real-time messaging with Kafka. The key components of this architecture will include a front-end developed with Angular, a back-end using Spring Boot for microservices, and databases like MongoDB and Oracle for storing data. Additionally, Agile PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) is used for managing product data, and we need to provide metrics for the system.

Let me explain the architecture and flow step by step:

1. System Overview
The system is designed to track and manage robotic deliveries for Amazon. Robots are used to deliver products from warehouses to customers, and data about these robots and deliveries is stored and managed in the system. The system is divided into two main parts:

Frontend (Angular): The frontend interacts with users (admin, customers, operators) to provide data visualization, dashboards, and manage delivery status.
Backend (Spring Boot Microservices): The backend handles business logic, communication between services, fault tolerance, and persistence of data.
Kafka: Kafka is used for event-driven communication between services (e.g., robot status updates, delivery notifications).
Databases (MongoDB, Oracle): MongoDB stores unstructured data (such as robot logs, event data), while Oracle stores structured data (like customer information, delivery routes, and product data).
Agile PLM: The Agile Product Lifecycle Management system stores product-related data, which may include product specifications, quality data, and lifecycle stages.
2. System Components and Flow
A. Frontend (Angular):

Dashboard: A real-time view of the robotic delivery status, with metrics such as delivery time, distance, robot battery level, etc.
User Interaction: Users can interact with the system to:
Track delivery progress.
Manage robots and set delivery routes.
Access product information stored in the Agile PLM system.
B. Backend (Spring Boot Microservices):

Microservice 1: User Management: Handles user authentication, roles, and permissions.
Microservice 2: Robot Management: Handles robot fleet management, monitoring, and status updates.
Microservice 3: Delivery Tracking: Monitors and tracks the progress of deliveries, communicates with robots via Kafka for status updates.
Microservice 4: Product Management: Retrieves and manages product data from the Agile PLM system and stores it in Oracle.
Microservice 5: Analytics and Metrics: Provides real-time analytics on delivery performance, robot health, product inventory, etc.
C. Communication (Kafka):

Kafka acts as a message broker for real-time communication between microservices. For example:
Robot Status Updates: When a robot completes a delivery, it sends an event to Kafka, which notifies the delivery tracking service.
Delivery Completion: Once a delivery is completed, an event is triggered to update the customer's dashboard.
D. Databases:

MongoDB: Stores logs and event data related to robots (e.g., status logs, battery levels, operational data).
Oracle: Stores transactional and structured data (e.g., customer orders, delivery routes, product data).
E. Agile PLM Integration:

The product data, lifecycle management, and product specifications are stored in an external system (Agile PLM). The backend services fetch product data from Agile PLM and store it in Oracle to provide a consistent view of the product in the tracking system.
3. System Flow Example: Robotic Delivery Process
Step 1: Order Placement
A customer places an order via the frontend Angular application.
The frontend sends the order details to the Order Management Microservice in the Spring Boot Backend.
The Order Management Microservice stores the order details in Oracle Database.
Step 2: Product Data Retrieval (Agile PLM)
The Product Management Microservice retrieves product data from the Agile PLM System, including product specifications, inventory data, and lifecycle stages.
This data is stored in Oracle for future access.
Step 3: Robot Assignment
Once the order is confirmed, the Delivery Tracking Microservice assigns a robot for the delivery.
The Robot Management Microservice retrieves available robots' data from MongoDB (e.g., battery status, location).
The system sends the assigned robot’s details to Kafka to notify other services.
Step 4: Robot Tracking and Delivery
The robot starts the delivery process. During the journey, the robot sends updates (e.g., location, battery status) to Kafka.
These events are consumed by the Delivery Tracking Microservice, which updates the frontend via WebSockets or REST API calls for real-time tracking.
Step 5: Delivery Completion
Upon successful delivery, the robot sends a “delivery completed” event to Kafka.
The Delivery Tracking Microservice updates the customer dashboard with the final status.
Step 6: Metrics and Analytics
The Analytics Microservice collects delivery data, robot performance data, and user interactions.
Real-time metrics are generated and displayed on the frontend dashboard, such as average delivery time, delivery success rate, and robot health statistics.
4. Fault Tolerance
Circuit Breaker Pattern: Using Spring Boot's Resilience4j or Hystrix for fault tolerance to handle service failures.
Kafka: Kafka ensures that messages (events) are not lost, providing durability. The system can retry processing failed events.
Database Replication: Ensure MongoDB and Oracle are replicated and resilient to failures by using replication strategies.
