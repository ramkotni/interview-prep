Full Project Design: Task Management Application
In this example, we will design a Task Management Application with the following:

Frontend: Built with React.js for the UI.
Backend: Built with Spring Boot for the API.
Deployment: The project will be deployed on AWS (Amazon Web Services) using EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instances for backend and S3 (Simple Storage Service) for the React frontend.
Architecture Overview
Frontend (React.js): A single-page application (SPA) where users can manage tasks (add, update, delete, and view tasks).

React will handle the UI and client-side routing.
Axios (or fetch) will be used to make HTTP requests to the Spring Boot backend.
Backend (Spring Boot): A RESTful API that manages task data and interacts with a database.

The backend will expose endpoints like GET /tasks, POST /tasks, DELETE /tasks/{id}, and PUT /tasks/{id}.
Spring Boot will provide security, authentication, and task management functionality.
Database: We'll use MySQL (or PostgreSQL) as the relational database for storing tasks.

Spring Boot will interact with the database using Spring Data JPA.
The tasks will have fields like id, name, description, status, and created_at.
Deployment on AWS:

The React frontend will be deployed on AWS S3 as a static website.
The Spring Boot backend will be deployed on AWS EC2.
The database will be hosted on AWS RDS (Relational Database Service).

Data Flow
Frontend:

The React frontend makes HTTP requests to the Spring Boot API using libraries like Axios or fetch.
It handles the presentation of tasks, allowing users to create, update, delete, and view tasks.
Backend:

The Spring Boot backend handles the HTTP requests.
It validates, processes, and stores data in the MySQL database via Spring Data JPA.
Spring Boot exposes REST endpoints to allow the frontend to interact with the backend.
Database:

The MySQL (or PostgreSQL) database stores the task data, which includes task names, descriptions, statuses, etc.
Spring Boot interacts with the database to persist and retrieve task data.
Tasks Involved in the Project
Here is the end-to-end list of tasks involved in building, testing, and deploying the project.

1. Frontend (React.js)
1.1 Setup React Project:

Initialize a new React project using create-react-app.
Install necessary dependencies (e.g., axios for making HTTP requests, react-router-dom for routing).
Create a basic layout for the Task Management App (Header, Task List, Add Task Form).
1.2 Implement UI Components:

TaskList Component: Display all tasks with options to delete and mark as complete.
Task Component: A single task UI with its name, description, status, and action buttons.
AddTask Component: A form for creating a new task with input fields for task name and description.
EditTask Component: Form to edit an existing task.
TaskFilters Component: Filter tasks by status (e.g., All, Completed, Pending).
1.3 Handle API Calls:

Use Axios to send requests to the Spring Boot backend:
GET /tasks to fetch all tasks.
POST /tasks to add a new task.
PUT /tasks/{id} to update a task.
DELETE /tasks/{id} to delete a task.
1.4 Styling:

Use CSS (or libraries like Material-UI or Bootstrap) for styling the application.
Implement a responsive design to ensure the app works well on mobile and desktop.
2. Backend (Spring Boot)
2.1 Setup Spring Boot Application:

Create a new Spring Boot application with dependencies for Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and MySQL (or PostgreSQL).
Set up the database connection in application.properties (AWS RDS credentials).
2.2 Create the Task Model:

Define a Task entity class with fields like id, name, description, status, and created_at.
Use JPA annotations to map this entity to a database table.
2.3 Create the Task Repository:

Define a repository interface extending JpaRepository<Task, Long> for CRUD operations.
2.4 Implement the Task Service:

Write a service class that interacts with the Task repository to handle business logic (e.g., creating, deleting, updating tasks).
2.5 Implement REST Controllers:

Create a TaskController class with REST endpoints (GET /tasks, POST /tasks, PUT /tasks/{id}, DELETE /tasks/{id}).
Handle exceptions and errors properly (e.g., task not found, validation errors).
2.6 Add Security (Optional):

Add basic authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) if needed for user authentication.
3. Database Setup (MySQL / PostgreSQL on AWS RDS)
3.1 Create RDS Database Instance:

Use AWS RDS to create a MySQL or PostgreSQL database instance.
Set up the database, and configure security groups for network access.
3.2 Configure Spring Boot Database Connection:

Update application.properties to point to the RDS instance, with credentials, database name, and connection URL.
4. Deployment on AWS
4.1 Deploy Frontend (React) on AWS S3:

Build the React app using npm run build.
Create an S3 bucket to store the static files.
Upload the build directory to the S3 bucket and enable static website hosting.
Set the appropriate CORS settings to allow frontend-backend interaction.
4.2 Deploy Backend (Spring Boot) on AWS EC2:

Create an EC2 instance using the AWS Management Console or via CLI.
SSH into the EC2 instance and install necessary tools (Java, Spring Boot JAR).
Build the Spring Boot application (mvn clean install) and deploy it to the EC2 instance.
Set up a reverse proxy (e.g., using Nginx) to route traffic from port 80 to your Spring Boot backend (running on port 8080).
4.3 Configure AWS Security Groups:

Configure Security Groups for both the EC2 instance and RDS to allow communication between the frontend, backend, and database.
4.4 Set Up AWS CloudWatch (Optional):

Set up CloudWatch to monitor logs, metrics, and performance of your application on AWS.
Example of a Task Management API (Spring Boot)
Here’s a simple example of how the Spring Boot backend might look:

Task Model
java
Copy
@Entity
public class Task {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private String description;
    private boolean completed;

    // Getters and Setters
}
Task Repository
java
Copy
@Repository
public interface TaskRepository extends JpaRepository<Task, Long> {
}
Task Service
java
Copy
@Service
public class TaskService {
    @Autowired
    private TaskRepository taskRepository;

    public List<Task> getAllTasks() {
        return taskRepository.findAll();
    }

    public Task createTask(Task task) {
        return taskRepository.save(task);
    }

    public void deleteTask(Long id) {
        taskRepository.deleteById(id);
    }

    public Task updateTask(Long id, Task taskDetails) {
        Task task = taskRepository.findById(id)
                .orElseThrow(() -> new ResourceNotFoundException("Task not found"));
        task.setName(taskDetails.getName());
        task.setDescription(taskDetails.getDescription());
        task.setCompleted(taskDetails.isCompleted());
        return taskRepository.save(task);
    }
}
Task Controller
java
Copy
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/tasks")
public class TaskController {
    @Autowired
    private TaskService taskService;

    @GetMapping
    public List<Task> getAllTasks() {
        return taskService.getAllTasks();
    }

    @PostMapping
    public Task createTask(@RequestBody Task task) {
        return taskService.createTask(task);
    }

    @PutMapping("/{id}")
    public Task updateTask(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody Task task) {
        return taskService.updateTask(id, task);
    }

    @DeleteMapping("/{id}")
    public void deleteTask(@PathVariable Long id) {
        taskService.deleteTask(id);
    }
}
Conclusion
This Task Management Application involves setting up a React frontend for UI, a Spring Boot backend for handling tasks, and deploying it all on AWS. You’ll need to:

Create UI components in React.
Set up REST APIs in Spring Boot for CRUD operations.
Host the frontend on AWS S3 and the backend on AWS EC2.
Store data in AWS RDS (MySQL/PostgreSQL).
Set up necessary AWS security configurations.
This is a scalable architecture, where both frontend and backend can be scaled independently, and the backend can interact with a cloud database for persistence.
