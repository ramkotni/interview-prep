Amazon Robotics has developed several types of robots used in its fulfillment centers to assist with tasks like inventory management, picking, packing, and sorting. Some of the most notable robots include:

Kiva (now Amazon Robotics):

Kiva Systems, which Amazon acquired in 2012, is one of the most well-known robot systems. These robots are used to transport shelves of goods throughout Amazon warehouses.
Pegasus:

Pegasus is a type of robot designed to transport packages to packing stations, specifically used in Amazon's sorting centers.
SCARA (Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm):

SCARA is used for picking, packing, and assembly tasks in some of Amazon’s warehouses. It's an industrial robot arm capable of handling a variety of tasks.
Bert and Ernie:

These are two mobile robots used for autonomous material handling within Amazon’s fulfillment centers. They navigate around the warehouse and help organize and transport products.
Xanthus:

Xanthus is another mobile robot designed to help move shelves to workers, assisting with picking and storage in Amazon’s warehouses.
