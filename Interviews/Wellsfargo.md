The airport authority of India was upgraded the car airport, as per the recent notification issued by the AI, the airport has been classified integrated the airport from the guide For officially, source told me turban here today that
A company Pretty
i Hey, I'm Getting Recall I
and a good knowledge on The AWS power perspective, also, I
easy to ECS Alam laha,
I have good knowledge on Agile methodology. I
CS reactor And
yeah, we have an experience into the monolithic application and even the cloud computing like GCP two. Also as an full stack developer, I was also responsible To migrating of monolithic application to micro services, applications you
are you talking About the monolithic, two microservices application like I
so the moving from the will break down the single, larger application code bases into the smaller, independent services, each with own responsibility, allows from more flexible development, deployment and scaling by dividing the application into manageable units that can be updated and managed separately. Essential transformation is single, unified applications in the collection with the smaller, loosely coupled services that communicate with the each other via API. Major thing is key points that we should wanted to remember when transaction from monolithic to micro services application that are called the benefits. The benefits is nothing but increase the scalability, faster development cycle, improve the maintainability, better fault isolations and ability to use the different technologies of different services depends on their needs. So some of the migration strategies which we implemented, strangler pattern, identify bounded context and incremental migrations. I
uh increase the complexity in the managing of distributed system, potential performance overhead due to the inter service communication, data management across the multiple databases and need for robust Monitoring and orchestration tools you
the important consideration of migration to Microsoft, that is data management, deciding how to handle the data across, whether to split the data into separate database each micro services or maintaining a centralized database with clear access controls and communication protocol, choose appropriate communication mechanism like REST API, messaging queues and event stream to enable the interaction between the services, like implementation of service discovery system to discover locate available of micro services within the network. Monitoring and observability establish a comprehensive monitoring tool to track the health performance of individual services and overall systems,
tools in the senses. Eureka server is a discovery server.
Agile methodology, Scrum, Scrum, we are using Agile methodology JIRA is a platform which we Use.
JIRA, JIRA, JIRA, you
in the previous application, which we are using about of Amazon robotics here we are implementing of any end to end delivery application related. So previously, this monolithic application, now we migrated it into the microservices application and well defined APIs will be connected to it. And as we said, that COVID also will be helpful. We are from Amazon, so we are using of Amazon queue. Amazon queue is an AA tool which analysis of our code, code quality, quantum code maintainability, so defining of different various protocols, also it will be help us to identify the where maybe the risk factors which consisting in our code. We will provide that so they it was reduced the minimize execution time, to optimize our code and avoid the over allocating memories the different sizes for to find the optimal one and expected the high traffic, and used to prefer concurrency functions and reduce the code start time, but It comes with additional costs and low cost maintainability. You
yes, We've built out An application. I
Can you repeat the question
in the past 16 of your experience, I was every year, so, like every year I have a good experience, also, like so that it will be easy for me to understand and have Any good
legacy technologies. I
a PDCA like a plan at the p a c, a c, plan and to do check, plan, PA, DC, so I follow the PDCA approaches. This is nothing but plan, ACT, PLAN do, act and check. So this is the way life cycle. We will analysis the problem statement where it is issued, and we will solve that problem.
You in I worked in the Amazon robotics
issues are, there is one problem that mechanical issues so this including the hardware failure sensor manipulation and movement problem. So the troubleshooting check, we inspect the sensor vehicles and mechanical part of wear and tear. We restart the robots and reset the internal system. We use the Amazon robotic monitoring tool to check the various errors. If the motor sensor is defective, will replace with the Amazon maintenance guidelines we have so that we will do it. The some of the software and communication failures are happens that is that robot depends on the software and the network connectivity and operating facility we check the Amazon monitoring tools to check the logs, and we ensure that Wi Fi and LAN connectivity is stable and we updated. We ensure that robot is running in the last software version, and report and re digitalization to restart the system and reload it configuration so
we navigate the path planning issues as a robot may be failure the Navigate properly due to the obstacle misalignment or mapping errors. Due to these things we use the proper ensuring that there should be unexpected abstract in the robotic path. Perform the sensor and reclaiming improves the accuracy, robust really these on the positioning and use The internal to analysis on the path, finders errors you
JL, Piper,
no I
job
knowledge on that. Yeah,
mobile programming we did so the mobile programming we implemented, like all the people who of the developers need to work in the particular problem solving. People
of the developers need to work in a particular problem statement, and we are having a good idea about of pair programming, also like navigator and the driver. So to solve the problems, so
So yml file is nothing but YAML file. So YAML file is the it is refers like
complex applications need to be
complex applications also, applications also we need understand. It's basically configuration file writing in yaml. So data serialization language. It is yaml. Files are often used to store and transmit the data and commonly used in the DevOps. It is popular programming language that is easy to read and understand. It is strict superset of JSON, another data serialization language the use to intended and new lines to indicate the structure, instead of relaying on the brackets and the braces work with the modern programming languages. So
like in Kubernetes files we are using like Kat is even in Spring Boot application also we use that YAML documentation. Instead of writing of an application dot property, we are using application dot yml documentation in Docker compose file,
yes, we use Yes. We have an idea about of Kubernetes, also,
for sports, in Kubernetes are nothing but a it's a group of more or one or more container that can share the resources and run together ports are similarly a unit of deployments in The Kubernetes.
So benefits are nothing, but like if you if you're using off with a Cuban, it is easier management, scaling and resource alleged allocation by the group related to the container together, it will share the networks, sharing networks, namespaces, IP address and storage volume, which simplifies the communication and the data sharing between the containers within a port ultimately enhance The application stability and availability within a cluster,
cluster so
can You repeat again the question? Please do?
Can you repeat again? Once more? Question, please. You
uh, excess vulnerabilities. Are you talking?
Okay? Sequel, uh, sorry. Sequel, injections are nothing but a it is.
It's a targeting for the data driven application by inserting of miscellaneous SQL statements via user inputs. This technique can be used to attack the application by inserting miscreative SQL statements into the user input,
unauthorized like unauthorized accessors under System compromising to prevent The SQL injection, developers should use the parameterized queries validate the user inputs and limited database privileges. Additionally, web application should be regularly updated with security patches and tested For the vulnerabilities so
for SQL injection, you're talking I
Yeah, parameter tampering we use to manipulate The input parameter to inject The miscellaneous SQL code. I

Thank You.
