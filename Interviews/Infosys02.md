Q&A Format (Based on Your Experience)

Q1: Can you walk me through the project you worked on as a Java developer?
A: Sure. I worked on an enterprise financial platform that could handle real-time transactions, portfolio management, and analytics for millions of users.
On the backend, I built microservices using Spring Boot. These services leveraged Apache Kafka for real-time event streaming and Redis for caching and performance optimization. I also designed RESTful and GraphQL APIs and implemented security with JWT, OAuth2, and role-based access control, ensuring compliance with financial security standards.

On the frontend, I worked with Angular, building dashboards using NgRx state management and Angular lifecycle hooks. I implemented real-time updates such as live stock prices and transaction alerts using WebSockets.

For data, I worked with both PostgreSQL and MongoDB, leveraging indexing and aggregation pipelines for fast analytics queries.

We deployed the application on AWS (EC2, RDS, DynamoDB, Lambda, serverless processes) and used Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and CLI for CI/CD pipelines.
For observability, we integrated Datadog, Splunk, and CloudWatch to monitor performance and logs.

The team size was about 10 members (4 onsite, 6 offshore). I collaborated closely with them on design, development, and performance tuning.

Q2: What kind of performance issues did you face, and how did you handle them?
A: One key challenge was high latency and low concurrency in production. To solve this:

We tuned database connection pools (HikariCP, BoneCP) and external service client pools.

Introduced Redis caching to reduce repeated expensive calls.

Optimized logging levels (less verbose in production).

Enabled Micrometer & APM tools for performance monitoring.

Disabled development-only tools (Spring DevTools, in-memory DB) in production.

This helped us reduce latency and improve concurrency handling.

Q3: What databases did you use? SQL or NoSQL?
A: We used both SQL and NoSQL.

PostgreSQL for transactional data (ACID consistency, joins).

MongoDB for flexible, semi-structured data and analytics use cases.

We used transactional annotations (@Transactional) for ensuring atomicity and consistency across multiple operations. For connection pooling, we tuned HikariCP.

Q4: How did you manage inter-service communication?
A:

For synchronous communication: REST APIs.

For asynchronous communication: Kafka and RabbitMQ.

We used circuit breakers and consumer acknowledgements in RabbitMQ. Messages were retried automatically. Failed messages were routed to Dead Letter Queues (DLQ) for reprocessing or logging.

Q5: Did you use any feature toggles or centralized configuration?
A: Yes, we used Spring Cloud Config Server for centralized configuration.

Feature flags were stored in Git and could be dynamically refreshed using Spring Cloud Bus.

In some cases, we also used Azure App Configuration and key-value stores for feature flagging.

This allowed us to enable/disable features without restarting services.

Q6: Why MongoDB? Why not relational DB only?
A: MongoDB was chosen because:

It supports flexible schemas (JSON-based documents).

It scales horizontally via sharding.

It’s better for semi-structured data, catalog management, and real-time analytics.

While relational DBs enforce strict schemas with foreign keys and normalization, MongoDB allowed us to adapt quickly to evolving requirements.

Q7: Did you explore Cassandra or DynamoDB?
A: Cassandra is good for high write throughput and partition tolerance, but in this project we used MongoDB as per client requirement.
For some serverless use cases, we used DynamoDB for rapid development and handling large, varied datasets with strong consistency.

Q8: Did you work with Elasticsearch?
A: Yes. We used Elasticsearch for:

Full-text search,

Log analytics,

Fraud detection,

Application monitoring.

We implemented custom analyzers (character filters, tokenizers, token filters) to handle special characters and indexing requirements.

Q9: Can you explain analyzers in Elasticsearch?
A: An analyzer is a package that processes raw text into tokens for indexing. It has 3 components:

Character filters (remove/replace unwanted characters).

Tokenizer (split text into tokens).

Token filters (modify tokens, e.g., lowercase).

We sometimes created custom analyzers for handling special characters and strict keyword searches.

✅ This structure makes your explanation interview-ready, clear, and easy for the interviewer to follow.

Do you want me to make this even more concise (5–7 min version) for answering in interviews, or keep it as detailed (20–25 min deep dive)?
