Q1: How do you communicate between microservices in your application?
A1: We use Kafka to communicate between microservices. For example, when changes are made to customer data in the customer service, those changes are broadcast to all downstream applications via Kafka topics. Each topic has its own consumer group, allowing multiple services to consume the data simultaneously.

Q2: Can you explain the concept of stream pipelining in Java?
A2: Stream pipelining refers to the process of chaining multiple stream operations together, like map and filter. These operations are divided into two types:

Intermediate operations: These return another stream as output (e.g., map, filter).
Terminal operations: These return a non-stream result (e.g., collect, forEach). Only one terminal operation can be performed in a stream pipeline, but you can chain multiple intermediate operations.
Q3: What features of Java 8 do you work with?
A3: We primarily use features like:

Functional programming (e.g., lambdas)
Stream API for handling collections
Optional class for null safety
Java Date and Time API for managing date and time operations
Q4: What is the purpose of the Optional class in Java?
A4: The Optional class helps prevent NullPointerExceptions by explicitly representing the presence or absence of a value. It provides methods like isPresent() and ifPresent() to handle values in a more functional and safe manner.

Q5: How do you handle large-scale application performance?
A5: We perform profiling to monitor memory usage and behavior under different loads. We use asynchronous programming to offload tasks and minimize load on the processing system. Additionally, we use chunk-based processing to handle records in batches, which helps manage the load more efficiently.

Q6: How do you handle caching in your system?
A6: We use annotations like @Cacheable for caching and configure cache headers for RESTful APIs. We use Ehcache as an in-memory cache and Redis as a distributed cache to improve performance and reduce database load.

Q7: What tools do you use for monitoring and health checks?
A7: We use Actuator endpoints for health checks and monitoring. Tools like Prometheus and Grafana are integrated for monitoring, while distributed tracing helps trace and monitor requests across services.

Q8: How do you manage CI/CD pipelines in your projects?
A8: We use Jenkins-based CI/CD pipelines for our deployments. The pipeline includes several stages like:

Build stage
Unit test stage
Security stage
Code quality gate (via SonarQube integration)
Artifact deployment (via Artifactory)
Q9: Do you have experience with front-end frameworks like Angular and React?
A9: Yes, I have experience working with both Angular and React. I am comfortable using both for building dynamic and responsive web applications.

Q10: How do you handle routing and lazy loading in Angular?
A10: In Angular, we use the loadChildren attribute to implement lazy loading in the routing module. This helps load components only when needed, improving performance and reducing the initial load time.

Q11: How do you manage authentication and authorization in your front-end applications?
A11: We use an authorization server to handle authentication. The authorization header is included in all outgoing API calls using HTTP interceptors. This ensures secure communication between the front-end and back-end services.

Q12: How do you handle state management in Angular?
A12: We use local storage to maintain the state of the application. This ensures that the state persists even if the page is reloaded.

Q13: What UI libraries do you use in your front-end applications?
A13: I have worked with Angular Material for building responsive UI components and have experience with Bootstrap for styling and layout.

Q14: Can you explain the concept of accessibility in web development?
A14: Accessibility standards ensure that web applications are usable by people with disabilities. For example, visually impaired users can navigate the app using keyboard shortcuts like tab access, allowing them to interact with the app without a mouse.

Q15: Can you explain the merge sort algorithm and its time complexity?
A15: Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into smaller sub-arrays, sorts them, and then merges them back together. It works by repeatedly dividing the array into halves until the base case (array length â‰¤ 1) is reached, then merging the sorted arrays.
The time complexity of merge sort is O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
