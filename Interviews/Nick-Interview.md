| **What is Spring Boot?**                               | Spring Boot is a framework that simplifies the setup and development of Spring-based applications. It offers production-ready features like embedded servers, health checks, and metrics without requiring a lot of configuration.                                                       |
| **What is Lazy Loading in Spring Boot?**               | Lazy loading in Spring Boot is when beans are not loaded until they are requested. This reduces memory usage and startup time, particularly useful for large applications with many beans.                                                                                           |
| **How can you change server configuration in Spring Boot if you don't need Tomcat?** | You can exclude Tomcat and configure an alternative server like Jetty or Undertow by modifying the `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file, using the following code snippet: `<dependency><groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId><artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId><exclusions><exclusion><groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId><artifactId>spring-boot-starter-tomcat</artifactId></exclusion></exclusions></dependency>` |
| **What is @Qualifier in Spring Boot?**                 | `@Qualifier` is used to resolve ambiguity when multiple beans of the same type are present. It specifies which bean to inject into the class when using `@Autowired`.                                                                                                              |
| **What is @Bean in Spring Boot?**                       | `@Bean` is used to declare a Spring bean in a configuration class. It helps define custom beans, which Spring will manage and add to the application context.                                                                                                                     |
| **What is Spring Boot AutoConfiguration?**              | AutoConfiguration in Spring Boot is a mechanism that automatically configures application beans based on the classpath and the properties in `application.properties`. This allows you to avoid explicit configuration for common use cases.                                           |
| **What is @SpringBootApplication annotation?**          | `@SpringBootApplication` is a convenience annotation that combines `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan` in one. It marks the main class of a Spring Boot application and enables auto-configuration and component scanning.                           |
| **What is Actuator in Spring Boot?**                    | Spring Boot Actuator provides production-ready features like health checks, metrics, and application information. It helps monitor and manage applications. The `/actuator` endpoints can expose various metrics like health, environment, etc.                                        |
| **How do you configure logging in Spring Boot?**        | Spring Boot uses `logback` by default for logging. You can configure logging using `application.properties` or `application.yml` with properties like `logging.level`, `logging.file`, or `logging.pattern.console`.                                                              |

## Kafka

| **Question**                                           | **Answer**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **What is Kafka?**                                      | Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that is used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It allows for fault-tolerant, high-throughput messaging between systems.                                                                          |
| **What is the difference between Kafka and RabbitMQ?**   | Kafka is designed for high throughput, fault tolerance, and stream processing, whereas RabbitMQ is more of a message broker designed for message queuing with a focus on message delivery guarantees. Kafka is more suited for real-time analytics and data pipelines.                 |
| **What is Offset in Kafka?**                           | The offset in Kafka is a unique identifier for each message within a partition. Kafka consumers use offsets to track their position in a partition, ensuring that they can resume reading from the correct point in case of a failure.                                                 |
| **What is Zookeeper in Kafka?**                         | Zookeeper is a distributed coordination service used by Kafka to manage metadata, broker configurations, topic partitions, and leader elections. It ensures high availability and consistency within Kafka clusters.                                                             |
| **Why is Replication required in Kafka?**              | Replication ensures fault tolerance in Kafka. By replicating data across multiple brokers, Kafka guarantees that if a broker fails, another broker with a replica of the data will take over, ensuring no data loss and high availability.                                           |
| **What is Kafka Producer and Consumer?**                | A **Kafka Producer** sends messages to Kafka topics, while a **Kafka Consumer** reads messages from Kafka topics. Producers and consumers are the key components that interact with Kafka to provide message-driven applications.                                               |
| **What is a Kafka Broker?**                             | A Kafka broker is a server that stores messages, receives and sends data to clients (producers/consumers), and ensures data durability and availability by managing topic partitions and replicas.                                                                                     |
| **What is a Kafka Topic?**                              | A Kafka topic is a category to which messages are sent. Producers write to topics, and consumers read from topics. Topics can be partitioned for parallel processing.                                                                                                              |
| **What is the role of Consumer Group in Kafka?**        | A Kafka consumer group consists of multiple consumers that divide the load of reading messages from topics. Each consumer in the group reads from a different partition to parallelize the work. Consumer groups help Kafka scale horizontally.                                       |

| **What is React?**                                      | React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of the application efficiently through its virtual DOM.                                                                                       |
| **What is JSX?**                                        | **JSX (JavaScript XML)** is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML elements and components in JavaScript. JSX is compiled to JavaScript before execution.                                                                                                  |
| **What is the difference between Props and State in React?** | **Props** are immutable and are passed from a parent component to a child component, while **State** is mutable and used to manage dynamic data within a component. State is local to a component, whereas props are passed down from parent to child. |
| **What is the purpose of React's Virtual DOM?**        | The **Virtual DOM** is an in-memory representation of the actual DOM elements. React uses it to optimize UI rendering by first making changes to the virtual DOM and then updating the actual DOM only if necessary, improving performance.                                      |
| **What is React Lifecycle?**                            | React **Lifecycle** refers to the series of methods that are invoked during a component's lifespan (from creation to removal). These include methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentWillUnmount`, and `shouldComponentUpdate`.                                                |
| **What is the use of `useEffect` hook in React?**       | `useEffect` is a React hook that allows you to perform side effects in function components, such as fetching data or subscribing to a service. It runs after every render by default but can be configured to run conditionally.                                                   |
| **What is React Router?**                               | **React Router** is a library used to handle navigation in a React application. It allows for the creation of dynamic routes and navigation between different views or pages in a single-page application (SPA).                                                                |
| **What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components in React?** | A **controlled component** is one whose form element values (e.g., input) are controlled by React state, while an **uncontrolled component** maintains its own internal state. Controlled components are typically preferred for their better control and predictability. |
