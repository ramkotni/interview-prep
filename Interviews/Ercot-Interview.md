Q: What is Angular and how is it different from AngularJS?

A: Angular is a TypeScript-based, free and open-source web application framework developed by Google and a community of developers. It is a complete rewrite of AngularJS, which was the earlier version of the framework, and is focused on building modern, dynamic, and scalable single-page applications (SPAs).

Q: What version of Angular are you currently using in your project?

A: I am currently working with Angular 15 in my project, and we are planning to upgrade to Angular 16 soon.

Q: Can you explain your experience with Angular in your recent project?

A: I worked on the Amazon Robotics ERP system where I interacted with REST APIs, used RxJS for handling asynchronous operations, and optimized page load times using techniques like lazy loading and caching. I used Angular Material for UI components and NgRx for state management. A significant challenge I faced was handling large datasets efficiently, which I solved using pagination and virtual scrolling.

Q: What kind of architecture does your project use?

A: We follow a microservices architecture, with a Java Spring Boot backend. For databases, we use DynamoDB for login credentials, MongoDB for large product and warehouse data, and Oracle Database for vendor connectivity. The application runs on AWS, and we leverage various services like EC2, S3, SNS, and SQS for scaling, storage, and messaging.

Q: How do you handle production issues and debugging in your application?

A: I handle production issues by monitoring application performance, analyzing error logs, and collaborating with teams to resolve issues. For example, when we had a performance issue due to high concurrent API calls, I optimized queries, implemented API rate limiting, and used RxJS operators like debounceTime and switchMap to optimize data requests.

Q: What are the solutions you implemented for performance optimization in your Angular application?

A: I implemented lazy loading, caching, and optimized API requests to improve performance. Additionally, I worked on reducing the memory consumption of the application and improved response times through better handling of asynchronous operations using RxJS operators.

Q: How do you manage large datasets in the frontend?

A: In the Angular frontend, I used pagination and virtual scrolling to handle large datasets efficiently. This allowed us to load only a small subset of data at a time, reducing the page load time and improving performance.

Q: Can you explain your experience with state management in Angular?

A: I used NgRx for state management in Angular, which involves using actions, reducers, and selectors to manage the application state. This helps in keeping the state predictable and consistent across the application.

Q: How do you handle authentication and authorization in your application?

A: For authentication and authorization, we use Amazon Cognito integrated with Angular. We implement JWT tokens for role-based authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific endpoints. Spring Security is used for backend security and managing authentication.

Q: Can you explain the challenges you faced with the ERP system's order processing?

A: One of the critical challenges was the delay in order processing within the ERP system, leading to a backlog in the warehouse automation. The root cause was high-frequency database queries and unoptimized API calls. We solved this by indexing queries, implementing API rate limiting, caching with Redis, and using RxJS operators to optimize API calls in the frontend.

Q: How do you handle memory management issues in production?

A: We monitor the application's memory usage and use profiling tools to detect memory leaks. In case of memory exhaustion, we optimize the application code, increase the available memory on the server, and adjust JVM settings like heap size to prevent out-of-memory errors.

Q: Can you explain the architecture and networking setup of your application?

A: The application runs across seven availability zones in AWS, with each zone connected to an internet gateway and load balancer. We use Route 53 for DNS management, and applications are deployed in public subnets. Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) ensure the scaling of microservices deployed in private subnets, and all microservices are connected to databases like RDS and DynamoDB.

Q: How do you ensure the scalability of your application?

A: To ensure scalability, we use AWS services like Auto Scaling Groups, Load Balancers, and Elastic Beanstalk to automatically adjust resources based on demand. The application is designed to handle large volumes of concurrent users and data efficiently.

Q: What strategies do you use for error handling in Angular?

A: In Angular, we use RxJS operators like catchError to handle errors in observables. This helps to gracefully manage failed API requests and show appropriate error messages to the user without crashing the application.

Q: What are your thoughts on the future of Angular, especially with version 18?

A: Angular 18 will likely introduce improvements to state management with signals and better handling of reactive programming. As a developer, I am excited to explore these new features and how they can improve application performance and maintainability.

Q: Can you explain the role of pagination and lazy loading in your project?

A: Pagination and lazy loading are crucial for optimizing the performance of the application. Pagination ensures that only a limited number of items are loaded at a time, while lazy loading allows components and modules to be loaded only when needed, reducing initial load time.

Q: How do you handle file uploads in your Spring Boot application?

A: In Spring Boot, we use the @RequestMapping or @PostMapping annotations to handle file uploads. We also use MultipartFile for receiving the uploaded file and store it temporarily. After successful upload, the file is scanned for viruses asynchronously to ensure security.

Q: Can you explain how you use RxJS in your Angular project?

A: RxJS is used extensively to handle asynchronous operations in Angular. Operators like mergeMap, switchMap, and debounceTime are used to manage API calls, handle user inputs, and optimize performance by minimizing unnecessary requests and handling concurrent operations effectively.

Q: What are your best practices for API development?

A: Some best practices include:

Accept and respond with JSON.
Use nouns instead of verbs in endpoint paths.
Maintain collection names in plural form.
Implement proper error handling and status codes.
Optimize performance through caching, pagination, and filtering.
Use versioning to ensure backward compatibility.

# Angular Interview Q&A

| **Question** | **Answer** |
|--------------|------------|
| **1. What is the latest version of Angular used?** | As of February 2025, Angular 15 is the latest stable version. |
| **2. How will you connect an API from Angular?** | Angular connects to an API using the `HttpClientModule`. You inject `HttpClient` service into your component or service, and then use methods like `get()`, `post()`, `put()`, or `delete()` to communicate with the API. Example: ```this.httpClient.get('API_URL').subscribe(response => { console.log(response); });``` |
| **3. What are the methods in Angular?** | Common Angular methods include: <ul><li>`ngOnInit()` – Lifecycle hook that runs when a component is initialized.</li><li>`ngOnChanges()` – Called when an input property changes.</li><li>`ngDoCheck()` – Custom change detection.</li><li>`ngAfterViewInit()` – After component’s view initialization.</li><li>`ngOnDestroy()` – Cleanup before destroying the component.</li></ul> |
