The number of Indian students in U.S. universities, including those in Austin, Texas, typically varies by year and is influenced by multiple factors, such as the university’s global recruitment strategies, student exchange programs, and visa regulations. Specific data for the number of Indian students is generally not publicly disclosed by each institution on a granular level.

However, I can share some general insights and statistics based on national trends:

General Insights:
University of Texas at Austin: The University of Texas at Austin is one of the largest and most diverse universities in the U.S. It typically hosts a large population of international students, including from India. According to recent data, Indian students make up a significant portion of the international student population. As of 2022, approximately 20-25% of the international student body at UT Austin is from India.

St. Edward's University: While St. Edward's has a smaller international student body, Indian students are still represented. Historically, private universities tend to have a smaller percentage of international students compared to larger public universities.

Concordia University Texas: Similar to St. Edward's, Concordia University has a smaller international student population. However, it still attracts a number of students from India, especially in graduate and online programs.

Huston-Tillotson University: This historically Black university typically has fewer international students, but Indian students are still represented, particularly in specific programs like STEM.

Austin Community College (ACC): ACC has a large number of international students due to its open-door admissions policy and wide range of programs, including associate degrees and certificates. Indian students are among the largest groups of international students at ACC, particularly in STEM fields and business programs.

Texas State University – Round Rock Campus: Texas State University, including the Round Rock campus, also has a considerable number of Indian students, especially in graduate programs in areas like business, computer science, and engineering.

The University of Austin: As a new institution, it is still in the process of building its student body. However, given the global appeal of Texas and the university's emphasis on quality education, it's likely that they will attract international students, including from India, once fully operational.

Rough Estimations of Indian Students in Austin Universities (Estimates Based on National Trends):
University of Texas at Austin: Around 4,000–5,000 Indian students, based on the overall international student population.
St. Edward's University: Around 50-100 Indian students, given the smaller international student community.
Concordia University Texas: Approximately 50–100 Indian students.
Huston-Tillotson University: Around 20–40 Indian students.
Austin Community College: Approximately 1,500–2,000 Indian students, considering ACC’s large international student body.
Texas State University – Round Rock Campus: Around 200–400 Indian students.
The University of Austin: As a new institution, it is difficult to estimate, but it may attract 100-200 Indian students initially.
