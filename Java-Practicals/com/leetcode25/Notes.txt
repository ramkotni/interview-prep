Key Themes:
Array: Problems involving sorting, searching, and finding subarrays.

String: Problems focusing on string manipulation, pattern matching, and dynamic programming.

Dynamic Programming: Problems that involve finding the optimal solution over subproblems (e.g., Maximum Subarray, Climbing Stairs).

Backtracking: Problems where you need to try all possibilities and backtrack if a solution doesn’t work (e.g., Subsets, Permutations).

Linked List: Many problems involving operations on singly or doubly linked lists (e.g., Merge Intervals, Detect Cycle).

Binary Search: Problems that can be solved using binary search, often with sorted arrays or matrices (e.g., Search in Rotated Sorted Array).

Why These Problems Are Repeated:
Conceptual Coverage: These problems cover important algorithms and data structures like arrays, strings, dynamic programming, binary search, hashmaps, linked lists, etc.

Practicality: These are commonly encountered in real-world systems and applications, which makes them useful to test during interviews.

Problem-Solving Skills: These problems test your ability to break down a complex problem into smaller, manageable parts while using efficient algorithms.

By practicing these common LeetCode problems, you'll be well-prepared for the types of questions you might face in FAANG interviews.
