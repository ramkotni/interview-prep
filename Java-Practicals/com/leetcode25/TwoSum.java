/**
 * 
 * Problem:
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Solution:
A common and efficient approach to solve the Two Sum problem is to use a HashMap. This allows us to store the numbers we've seen and check if the complement of the current number (i.e., target - current number) is already in the map. This results in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
 * 
 * 
 * Explanation:
HashMap: We use a HashMap<Integer, Integer> to store the numbers weâ€™ve encountered and their corresponding indices.

Loop: We loop through the nums array. For each number nums[i], we calculate its complement (target - nums[i]).

Check Complement: If the complement is already in the map, it means we've previously encountered a number that can sum with the current number to give the target. We then return the indices of the current number and the complement.

Add Current Number: If the complement is not found, we add the current number and its index to the map for future reference.

Time Complexity: This approach runs in O(n) time, where n is the length of the array. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the space required by the HashMap.
