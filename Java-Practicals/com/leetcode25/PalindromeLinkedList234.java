/**
 * The Palindrome Linked List problem (LeetCode #234) asks you to determine if a singly linked list is a palindrome. A linked list is a palindrome if the sequence of values from the head to the tail is the same as from the tail to the head.
Problem Statement:
Given a singly linked list, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.
Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,2,1]
Output: true
Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: false
Approach:
We can solve this problem efficiently in O(n) time with O(1) space (excluding the space used for input), by using a two-pointer approach.
Steps to Solve:
Find the middle of the linked list:
Use the fast and slow pointer technique (also known as the tortoise and hare technique) to find the middle of the list. The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time. When the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer will be at the middle.
Reverse the second half of the linked list:
After finding the middle, reverse the second half of the list starting from the slow pointer.
Compare the two halves:
Compare the first half of the list with the reversed second half. If they match, the list is a palindrome; otherwise, it is not.
Restore the list (optional):
Optionally, you can restore the original list structure by reversing the second half again and connecting it back to the first half, but this is not strictly required for this problem.
 * 
 * Explanation:
Finding the middle of the list:
We use two pointers: slow and fast. The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time. When fast reaches the end of the list, slow will be at the middle.
Reversing the second half:
After finding the middle, the reverse() method is used to reverse the second half of the list starting from the slow pointer.
Comparison:
After reversing the second half, we compare it with the first half. If the values match, we return true, indicating the list is a palindrome. If any value doesn't match, we return false.
Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) because we are not using any extra space other than a few pointer variables for the traversal and reversal.
Time Complexity:
The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. We traverse the list twice â€” once to find the middle and once to compare the two halves.
Example Walkthrough:
For the input head = [1, 2, 2, 1]:
First, we find the middle using the fast and slow pointer technique. The slow pointer will end up at the value 2 (the middle).
Next, we reverse the second half of the list starting from 2, which results in the list [1].
Finally, we compare the first half [1, 2] with the reversed second half [1, 2]. Since they are equal, the list is a palindrome.
For the input head = [1, 2]:
The fast and slow pointers will detect that there is no palindrome because the first and second half are different (1 != 2).
Conclusion:
This solution is efficient with O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity, excluding the input space. It ensures that the list is checked for being a palindrome by using the slow and fast pointers and reversing the second half of the list.
