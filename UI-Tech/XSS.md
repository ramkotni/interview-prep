XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) is a type of security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts (usually JavaScript) into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can then be executed in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to a variety of harmful outcomes such as data theft, session hijacking, or unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user.

Key Points:
Injected Scripts: The attacker injects malicious code (usually JavaScript) into a webpage that is then executed by other users' browsers when they visit the page.
Victims: The users who view the compromised page or interact with the malicious content are the victims.
Types of XSS:
Stored XSS: The malicious script is permanently stored on the target server (e.g., in a database) and executed whenever a user visits the affected page.
Reflected XSS: The malicious script is reflected off the server, typically via a URL or a user input (like a search query), and executed in the user's browser. It doesn’t get stored on the server.
DOM-based XSS: This type occurs when the client-side JavaScript manipulates the DOM (Document Object Model) in an insecure manner, causing the injection of malicious content into the page.
How XSS Works:
An attacker identifies a vulnerability in a web application where they can inject untrusted data (such as through a form input or URL parameter).
The attacker submits malicious JavaScript code in this input.
The application displays the data without properly sanitizing or encoding it.
When another user visits the affected page, the malicious script is executed in their browser.
The attacker may steal cookies, redirect users to a malicious website, or impersonate the user by performing actions on their behalf.
Potential Risks of XSS:
Session Hijacking: Stealing a user's session cookies to impersonate them and access their account.
Phishing: Redirecting the user to a fake site or displaying deceptive forms to steal sensitive information.
Defacement: Altering the appearance of a website or injecting inappropriate content.
Malware: Redirecting users to sites that deliver malicious downloads.
Prevention:
Input Validation: Always validate and sanitize user inputs (e.g., via input validation libraries or frameworks).
Output Encoding: Encode dynamic content (like user input) before displaying it in the browser to ensure it’s treated as data, not code.
Content Security Policy (CSP): Use CSP headers to restrict the types of scripts that can be executed in the browser.
Escape User Input: Escape user inputs when displaying them in HTML, JavaScript, or other contexts.
Use Secure Libraries: Many frameworks (like React, Angular, etc.) automatically escape user input to help prevent XSS.
Example of Reflected XSS:
An attacker sends a URL like:

php-template
Copy
http://example.com/search?q=<script>alert('XSS')</script>
If the application doesn't sanitize the input q properly, it will return the script in the search result page and execute it in the user's browser, causing an alert popup.

In summary, XSS is a dangerous vulnerability that can lead to serious security risks for users and websites. Proper input validation, encoding, and other security measures are crucial to preventing XSS attacks.
