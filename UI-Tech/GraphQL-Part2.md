# GraphQL vs REST API

| Feature                | GraphQL                              | REST API                           |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Data Fetching**       | Clients can request exactly what they need, no over-fetching or under-fetching. | Each endpoint returns a fixed set of data, often with over-fetching. |
| **Single Endpoint**     | All queries and mutations are sent to a single endpoint (e.g., `/graphql`). | Multiple endpoints are used for different resources (e.g., `/users`, `/posts`). |
| **Response Structure**  | Customizable response, always returns in a consistent format. | Response format depends on endpoint, leading to potential inconsistency. |
| **Versioning**          | No versioning is needed. Clients can adapt to schema changes easily. | Versioning is required (e.g., `/v1/users`, `/v2/users`). |
| **Real-Time Support**   | Built-in support for real-time data with subscriptions. | Real-time support typically requires external technologies like WebSockets. |
| **Nested Data**         | Handles nested data and relations with a single query. | Requires multiple requests for related data. |
| **Error Handling**      | Returns detailed error messages along with data. | Error handling is often limited to HTTP status codes. |
| **Caching**             | Allows fine-grained caching by query. | Relies on HTTP caching, which can be inefficient for complex data. |
| **Complexity**          | Can handle complex queries, but requires careful design to avoid inefficiency. | Simple and efficient for basic CRUD operations, but struggles with complexity. |
| **Data Modification**   | Uses mutations for modifying data. | Uses standard HTTP methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`. |

## Example: End-to-End GraphQL Application

### Step 1: Setting Up the Server (Node.js with Apollo Server)

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm init -y
npm install apollo-server graphql
Create a server.js file:
javascript
Copy
Edit
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server');

// In-memory database (mock data)
let books = [
  { id: 1, title: '1984', author: 'George Orwell' },
  { id: 2, title: 'To Kill a Mockingbird', author: 'Harper Lee' },
];

const typeDefs = gql`
  type Book {
    id: ID!
    title: String!
    author: String!
  }

  type Query {
    books: [Book]
    book(id: ID!): Book
  }

  type Mutation {
    addBook(title: String!, author: String!): Book
    deleteBook(id: ID!): String
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    books: () => books,
    book: (parent, args) => books.find(book => book.id == args.id),
  },
  Mutation: {
    addBook: (parent, args) => {
      const newBook = { id: books.length + 1, title: args.title, author: args.author };
      books.push(newBook);
      return newBook;
    },
    deleteBook: (parent, args) => {
      books = books.filter(book => book.id != args.id);
      return `Book with ID ${args.id} deleted.`;
    },
  },
};

const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });

server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`Server ready at ${url}`);
});
Start the server:
bash
Copy
Edit
node server.js
Step 2: Querying the Server
Query: Get all books
graphql
Copy
Edit
query {
  books {
    id
    title
    author
  }
}
Query: Get a single book by ID
graphql
Copy
Edit
query {
  book(id: 1) {
    title
    author
  }
}
Mutation: Add a new book
graphql
Copy
Edit
mutation {
  addBook(title: "Brave New World", author: "Aldous Huxley") {
    id
    title
    author
  }
}
Mutation: Delete a book by ID
graphql
Copy
Edit
mutation {
  deleteBook(id: 2)
}
Step 3: Query Example via Apollo Client (Frontend)
Install Apollo Client:
bash
Copy
Edit
npm install @apollo/client graphql
In your React app, configure Apollo Client and send queries/mutations:
javascript
Copy
Edit
import React from 'react';
import { ApolloProvider, InMemoryCache, ApolloClient, useQuery, useMutation, gql } from '@apollo/client';

// Initialize Apollo Client
const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'http://localhost:4000',
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});

const GET_BOOKS = gql`
  query {
    books {
      id
      title
      author
    }
  }
`;

const ADD_BOOK = gql`
  mutation($title: String!, $author: String!) {
    addBook(title: $title, author: $author) {
      id
      title
      author
    }
  }
`;

const Books = () => {
  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_BOOKS);

  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  if (error) return <p>Error: {error.message}</p>;

  return (
    <div>
      {data.books.map((book) => (
        <div key={book.id}>
          <h3>{book.title}</h3>
          <p>{book.author}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

const AddBook = () => {
  let titleInput;
  let authorInput;
  const [addBook] = useMutation(ADD_BOOK);

  return (
    <div>
      <input ref={(node) => { titleInput = node; }} placeholder="Title" />
      <input ref={(node) => { authorInput = node; }} placeholder="Author" />
      <button onClick={() => {
        addBook({ variables: { title: titleInput.value, author: authorInput.value } });
        titleInput.value = '';
        authorInput.value = '';
      }}>Add Book</button>
    </div>
  );
};

const App = () => (
  <ApolloProvider client={client}>
    <h1>Books</h1>
    <Books />
    <AddBook />
  </ApolloProvider>
);

export default App;
Step 4: Run the Application
Run your frontend React application and interact with your GraphQL server. The app will allow you to query and mutate data in the GraphQL API.

Conclusion
GraphQL provides flexibility, efficiency, and precise control over data, while REST APIs offer simplicity for basic operations. This example demonstrates how GraphQL can be set up and used in a simple full-stack application.
