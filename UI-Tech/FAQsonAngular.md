1. What is Angular?
Answer:
Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. It is developed and maintained by Google. Angular provides a complete solution for building web applications, including data binding, routing, components, services, dependency injection, and more.

2. What are the key features of Angular?
Answer:

Two-way data binding: Automatically syncs data between the model and view.
Components: Building blocks of Angular applications; they control views and are reusable.
Directives: Special markers in HTML that enhance the behavior of DOM elements.
Dependency Injection: A design pattern used to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC), making services and other dependencies easier to manage.
Routing: Allows navigation between views and handles dynamic view rendering.
RxJS: A library for reactive programming using Observables to handle asynchronous data streams.
CLI: Angular's Command Line Interface (CLI) helps automate development tasks like creating components, services, and running the app.
Modularity: Angular allows the use of modules to organize code in an efficient and manageable way.
3. What is the difference between AngularJS and Angular?
Answer:

AngularJS (1.x) is a JavaScript-based framework, while Angular (2+) is a complete rewrite of AngularJS, built using TypeScript.
Angular uses TypeScript as its primary language, offering strong typing and object-oriented features.
Angular has a better architecture, using components instead of controllers and directives.
Angular has improved performance due to a faster change detection mechanism and better optimization.
4. What is a Component in Angular?
Answer:
A Component is the fundamental building block in Angular applications. It controls a part of the UI and includes:

Template: The HTML view associated with the component.
Class: Contains the logic for the component (e.g., properties, methods).
Metadata: Provided by the @Component decorator to define the selector, template, styles, etc.
Example:

typescript
Copy
@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  templateUrl: './my-component.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./my-component.component.css']
})
export class MyComponent {
  title = 'Angular Component';
}
5. What are Directives in Angular?
Answer:
Directives are markers on DOM elements that add behavior or modify the DOM in some way. There are three types of directives in Angular:

Structural Directives: Change the structure of the DOM (e.g., *ngIf, *ngFor).
Attribute Directives: Change the appearance or behavior of an element (e.g., ngClass, ngStyle).
Component Directives: These are components themselves.
6. What is Dependency Injection in Angular?
Answer:
Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used in Angular to manage how objects (dependencies) are injected into classes. Angular uses DI to provide services or other dependencies to components, directives, or other services. DI helps in decoupling the components, making them easier to test and maintain.

Example of DI in Angular:

typescript
Copy
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class DataService {
  constructor(private http: HttpClient) { }
}
7. What is Angular CLI?
Answer:
Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a tool that helps with automating various tasks in Angular applications, such as:

Creating components, services, modules, etc.
Running a local development server (ng serve).
Building the application (ng build).
Running tests (ng test).
Managing environment configurations.
Example of creating a new component using Angular CLI:

bash
Copy
ng generate component my-component
8. What is the difference between ngOnInit and constructor in Angular?
Answer:

constructor(): It is a JavaScript feature and is used to initialize the class. Angular doesn't call it explicitly for lifecycle hooks. It’s used for setting up dependency injection and other initialization.
ngOnInit(): This is an Angular lifecycle hook. It is called after Angular initializes the component's input properties and before rendering the view. It’s used for component initialization that depends on inputs or external data.
9. What are Observables in Angular?
Answer:
Observables are a part of the RxJS library and are used for handling asynchronous operations like HTTP requests, user events, and more. Observables emit values over time, and you can subscribe to them to get updates. They are used widely in Angular for HTTP requests and other reactive operations.

Example with HTTP request:

typescript
Copy
this.http.get('https://api.example.com/data').subscribe(data => {
  console.log(data);
});
10. What is a Service in Angular?
Answer:
A Service in Angular is a class that provides reusable logic or data throughout an application. Services are typically used for business logic, data access, and HTTP requests. They are injected into components or other services using Angular's dependency injection system.

Example:

typescript
Copy
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class DataService {
  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

  getData() {
    return this.http.get('https://api.example.com/data');
  }
}
11. What is Routing in Angular?
Answer:
Routing in Angular allows navigation between different views or components within a single-page application (SPA). Angular uses the RouterModule to configure and manage routes. Each route maps a URL to a specific component.

Example of setting up routing:

typescript
Copy
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'home', component: HomeComponent },
  { path: 'about', component: AboutComponent }
];
And in the component template:

html
Copy
<a routerLink="/home">Home</a>
<a routerLink="/about">About</a>
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
12. What is Lazy Loading in Angular?
Answer:
Lazy Loading is a technique that allows loading modules only when they are needed, instead of loading them at the start. This improves the performance of an Angular application, especially when dealing with large modules. It is achieved by using the loadChildren property in the route configuration.

Example:

typescript
Copy
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'admin', loadChildren: () => import('./admin/admin.module').then(m => m.AdminModule) }
];
13. What is Change Detection in Angular?
Answer:
Change Detection in Angular is a mechanism that checks and updates the DOM whenever there is a change in data or application state. Angular uses different strategies to perform change detection, like default and onPush change detection strategies. The default strategy checks for changes in all components, while the onPush strategy checks only when certain conditions (e.g., input properties change) are met.

14. What is an Angular Module?
Answer:
An Angular Module (NgModule) is a container that organizes an Angular application. It is a way to group components, directives, pipes, and services into cohesive blocks. Every Angular application has at least one module, known as the root module (AppModule).

typescript
Copy
@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
15. Explain the lifecycle hooks in Angular.
Answer:
Angular lifecycle hooks allow developers to tap into key moments of a component or directive’s lifecycle. Some important lifecycle hooks include:

ngOnInit(): Called after the component's data-bound properties are initialized.
ngOnChanges(): Called when an input property changes.
ngDoCheck(): Called during every change detection cycle.
ngOnDestroy(): Called just before the component is destroyed.
ngAfterViewInit(): Called after Angular has fully initialized a component’s views and child views.
ngAfterViewChecked(): Called after Angular has checked the component’s views.
