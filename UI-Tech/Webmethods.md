A web method is a function or operation in a web service that is accessible over the internet, typically through HTTP or HTTPS protocols. It is part of a web service and is designed to perform specific tasks, such as retrieving or manipulating data, processing requests, or performing actions that are requested by a client application.

Web methods can be part of different types of web services, such as:

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) Web Services:

SOAP web methods are part of a service that uses XML-based messages over HTTP/HTTPS to request and receive data.
These methods are defined in the WSDL (Web Service Definition Language) and are typically invoked using XML-RPC or HTTP POST requests.
REST (Representational State Transfer) Web Services:

RESTful web methods are typically associated with CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and are exposed as HTTP endpoints.
These web methods are accessed using HTTP verbs such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
GET: Retrieve data.
POST: Submit data for processing.
PUT: Update existing data.
DELETE: Remove data.
REST web services are more lightweight and are often preferred for modern web applications.
Example of a Web Method in a RESTful API:
In a RESTful API, a web method might be a specific endpoint like this:

GET /users: A web method that retrieves a list of users.
POST /users: A web method that allows adding a new user to the system.
PUT /users/{id}: A web method that updates the details of an existing user.
DELETE /users/{id}: A web method that deletes a specific user from the system.
Example of Calling a Web Method:
Here’s a basic example of calling a RESTful web method using the Fetch API in JavaScript:
// Calling a GET method to fetch user data from a REST API
fetch('https://api.example.com/users')  // This is the URL of the web method
  .then(response => response.json())  // Parsing the JSON response
  .then(data => console.log(data))    // Handling the data from the web method
  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));  // Handling errors

How Web Methods Work:
Client Sends Request: A client application sends a request (e.g., via HTTP/HTTPS) to the web service's URL. This request typically includes parameters (if needed), headers, and the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.).
Web Method Execution: The web service receives the request, processes it based on the web method’s logic, and performs the required actions (e.g., querying a database, performing computations).
Response Sent to Client: Once the web method completes its task, it sends back a response, often in a structured format like JSON, XML, or plain text, depending on the service and client expectations.
Key Characteristics of Web Methods:
Accessibility: Web methods are generally accessible over a network, allowing external clients (like web browsers, mobile apps, or other services) to interact with them.
Protocol-agnostic: They can work over various protocols, but most commonly use HTTP/HTTPS.
Stateless: In RESTful web services, web methods are stateless, meaning each request from a client to a web method is independent, and the server doesn't retain information between requests.
Conclusion:
Web methods are essential for building web services and enabling communication between distributed systems. By exposing specific operations through these methods, web services allow external applications to interact with a system over the internet, enabling functionality like retrieving data, processing requests, and integrating with external systems.
