## Conclusion

- **Angular** has evolved significantly from its early days with AngularJS (1.x) to the full-fledged framework it is today, with features like TypeScript support, the Ivy rendering engine, and powerful CLI tools.
- **React**, on the other hand, is a more flexible, lightweight library that focuses primarily on building user interfaces with features like hooks, JSX, and Concurrent Mode, giving developers the freedom to integrate other tools as needed.

Both frameworks have their own strengths, and the choice between them often depends on project n
