The 12-Factor App is a set of best practices for building modern, scalable, and maintainable software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications. Here's a simplified explanation of each factor:


Codebase: One codebase per application, tracked in version control, with multiple deployments (e.g., staging, production).


Dependencies: Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies (e.g., use package.json or pom.xml).


Config: Store configuration (e.g., database URLs, API keys) in environment variables, not in the code.


Backing Services: Treat external services (e.g., databases, queues) as attached resources that can be swapped without code changes.


Build, Release, Run: Separate the build (compile code), release (combine build with config), and run (execute the app) stages.


Processes: Run the app as stateless processes; share nothing between instances.


Port Binding: Expose services via port binding (e.g., a web server listens on a port).


Concurrency: Scale out by running multiple instances of processes.


Disposability: Make processes fast to start and stop for better scalability and reliability.


Dev/Prod Parity: Keep development, staging, and production environments as similar as possible.


Logs: Treat logs as event streams; aggregate and analyze them externally.


Admin Processes: Run admin/management tasks (e.g., database migrations) as one-off processes.


These principles help create apps that are portable, resilient, and easy to scale.
