TOGAF Summary â€“ Quick Glance
ðŸ”¹ 1. What is TOGAF?
A globally recognized enterprise architecture (EA) framework.

Provides a structured approach for designing, planning, implementing, and governing enterprise architecture.

Managed by The Open Group.

Based on the Architecture Development Method (ADM).

ðŸ”¹ 2. Key Components of TOGAF
a. Architecture Development Method (ADM)
The core of TOGAF, guiding the development of architecture in phases:

Preliminary Phase: Set up architecture capability (principles, governance, tools).

Phase A â€“ Architecture Vision: Define scope, stakeholders, and high-level vision.

Phase B â€“ Business Architecture: Model business strategy, governance, and processes.

Phase C â€“ Information Systems Architecture:

Data Architecture

Application Architecture

Phase D â€“ Technology Architecture: Define hardware, software, and network infrastructure.

Phase E â€“ Opportunities & Solutions: Identify projects and transition architectures.

Phase F â€“ Migration Planning: Create migration roadmap and implementation plan.

Phase G â€“ Implementation Governance: Ensure architecture compliance during execution.

Phase H â€“ Architecture Change Management: Monitor and manage changes.

Requirements Management (central): Handle requirements throughout ADM lifecycle.

ðŸ”¹ 3. TOGAF Content Framework
Architecture Content Metamodel: Defines artifacts, deliverables, and building blocks.

Architecture Repository: Stores all EA artifacts (reference models, standards, etc.).

Enterprise Continuum: Classifies assets from generic to specific (Foundation â†’ Organization-Specific).

Architecture Building Blocks (ABBs) vs Solution Building Blocks (SBBs):

ABBs: High-level capabilities.

SBBs: Concrete implementations.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Architecture Views and Viewpoints
View: A representation of a system from a viewpoint.

Viewpoint: A perspective addressing concerns of specific stakeholders.

ðŸ”¹ 5. TOGAF Reference Models
TRM (Technical Reference Model): Core platform services.

III-RM (Integrated Information Infrastructure Reference Model): For service integration and information sharing.

ðŸ”¹ 6. Architecture Governance
Ensures architecture compliance with business needs and standards.

Involves processes, roles, responsibilities, policies, and tools.

ðŸ”¹ 7. Architecture Capability Framework
Guides how to establish an EA practice in an organization.

Covers roles (e.g., Chief Architect), governance structures, tools, and skills.

ðŸ”¹ 8. Benefits of TOGAF
Reduces complexity.

Aligns IT with business goals.

Supports change and innovation.

Enhances risk management.

Promotes reuse and standardization.

ðŸ”¹ 9. TOGAF Certification Levels
Foundation (Part 1): Basic concepts and terminology.

Certified (Part 2): Practical application of TOGAF ADM and framework.
