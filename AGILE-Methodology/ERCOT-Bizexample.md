Absolutely! Here's a tailored list of Product Owner / Business Analyst questions with sample answers based on the electricity domain where ERCOT (Electric Reliability Council of Texas) is the client.

‚ö° Domain: Electricity Market (Client: ERCOT)
üß≠ Business Goals & Vision
Q1. What is the primary goal of this product/project?
A: To enhance real-time grid visibility for market participants and improve decision-making during high-load or emergency conditions.

Q2. What problem are we solving for the business or users?
A: Currently, market participants lack real-time forecasting and notifications, leading to delays in response during high-demand or supply fluctuation events.

Q3. What does success look like for this initiative?
A: A stable, more responsive electricity market where participants receive timely, actionable data and ERCOT can manage grid reliability efficiently.

Q4. What are the key KPIs this product should impact?
A: System frequency stability, generation-load balance, load forecasting accuracy, and stakeholder response time to alerts.

Q5. How does this align with ERCOT‚Äôs strategic objectives?
A: It supports ERCOT‚Äôs goal to modernize grid operations and enhance market efficiency, especially during grid stress or extreme weather.

üë• Stakeholders & Users
Q6. Who are the main stakeholders for this project?
A: ERCOT operations, market participants (generators, QSEs), PUCT, and internal compliance teams.

Q7. Who are the end users? What are their goals?
A: Qualified Scheduling Entities (QSEs), generators, and ERCOT operators. Their goal is to make informed generation/load decisions based on near real-time data.

Q8. Are there any compliance or legal requirements involved?
A: Yes. We must comply with NERC standards, PUCT guidelines, and ERCOT protocols related to system alerts and data transparency.

Q9. Are there competing priorities from different stakeholders?
A: Yes. While operators focus on grid stability, market participants focus on profitability and forecasting. We must balance reliability with market dynamics.

Q10. How will we handle conflicting stakeholder needs?
A: Through stakeholder engagement meetings, prioritization workshops, and decision logs managed by ERCOT‚Äôs governance board.

üîç Requirements & Scope
Q11. What are the core features expected?
A: Real-time alerting, visualization of grid status, load forecasts, generation availability, and historical trend analysis.

Q12. What is in scope vs. out of scope?
A:

In Scope: Data visualization dashboard, API integrations, ERCOT notice alerts

Out of Scope: Control room automation or dispatch systems

Q13. What assumptions are we making?
A: We assume ERCOT systems (e.g., EMS, MMS) will provide reliable, real-time data feeds, and QSEs have compatible tools to consume alerts.

Q14. What are the known technical constraints?
A: Latency in data feeds from SCADA, strict cybersecurity rules, and minimal downtime windows for integration.

Q15. What are the critical integrations needed?
A: Integration with ERCOT EMS (Energy Management System), MMS (Market Management System), and external alerting systems.

üîÑ Process & Workflows
Q16. What is the current (as-is) process?
A: Operators manually monitor grid conditions and send alerts to participants via bulletins or phone calls during critical events.

Q17. What changes are expected in the to-be process?
A: An automated system that generates and sends alerts based on pre-defined thresholds (e.g., frequency drop, reserve limits).

Q18. Are there any dependencies with other ERCOT systems?
A: Yes, dependency on the SCADA system for telemetry and the MMS for market data.

Q19. What manual steps are we automating?
A: Manual alert distribution, data aggregation, and load/generation anomaly detection.

Q20. What data inputs and outputs are involved?
A: Inputs: Real-time load, generation, tie flows, weather forecasts
Outputs: Grid status alerts, demand forecasts, generation availability reports

üß™ Validation & Testing
Q21. How will we validate the product meets the requirements?
A: Through functional testing, scenario simulations (e.g., extreme load), and UAT with ERCOT operators and QSEs.

Q22. What are the acceptance criteria?
A: Alerts are generated within 30 seconds of a threshold breach, data updates every 5 minutes, and 99.9% system uptime.

Q23. Who will sign off on deliverables?
A: ERCOT operations manager, project sponsor from regulatory/compliance, and key market participant representatives.

Q24. Are there edge cases to account for?
A: Yes, sudden generation trips, cyber-attack-induced data drops, and weather anomalies causing unplanned surges.

Q25. Will we need a staging environment for testing?
A: Yes, a secure test environment with simulated data feeds to validate performance and alert behavior.

üóìÔ∏è Timeline & Priorities
Q26. Are there any critical deadlines?
A: Yes, the first release must go live before the summer peak load season in June.

Q27. What are the top priorities for the first release?
A: Real-time grid alert system, load forecast module, and basic dashboard for ERCOT operators.

Q28. Is this planned as an MVP or full-scale launch?
A: An MVP is planned initially with gradual expansion to support additional data and user roles.

Q29. What risks could delay the project?
A: Data feed latency, integration issues with legacy ERCOT systems, or resource unavailability from vendors.

Q30. Is the project divided into sprints or milestones?
A: Yes, following Agile sprints with 2-week cycles and milestones defined per major feature group.

üìä Data & Reporting
Q31. What data or reports do stakeholders expect?
A: Daily system load reports, alert history logs, and 7-day load forecast accuracy metrics.

Q32. What key data should we track?
A: Real-time load vs. forecast, reserve capacity, generator outages, and system frequency.

Q33. Are we pulling data from existing ERCOT sources?
A: Yes, from ERCOT‚Äôs telemetry systems, weather prediction tools, and market reports.

Q34. How should historical data be used?
A: For trend analysis, anomaly detection, and improving load forecast accuracy through machine learning models.

Q35. Are there data privacy or security requirements?
A: Yes. Must adhere to ERCOT and NERC CIP (Critical Infrastructure Protection) standards.

üí¨ Communication & Feedback
Q36. How often do stakeholders want updates?
A: Weekly sprint reviews and monthly stakeholder briefings.

Q37. What‚Äôs the preferred communication channel?
A: Microsoft Teams for daily communication and SharePoint for documentation.

A: ERCOT Product Owner and Regulatory Liaison.

Q39. How will feedback be collected post-launch?
A: Via user surveys, feedback forms in the app, and regular review sessions with stakeholders.

Q40. Are there planned steering committee meetings?
A: Yes, bi-weekly governance meetings including ERCOT leadership and key participants.
