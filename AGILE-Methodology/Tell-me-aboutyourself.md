Hi, my name is Ram Mohan Kotni, and I bring over 16 years of experience as a Java Full Stack Developer with deep expertise in designing and delivering scalable, cloud-native, and high-performance applications across diverse industries like e-commerce, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, robotics, and finance.

I began my career in 2007 as a Java Developer at Wells Fargo, where I worked on Spring-based financial applications, improving payment processing efficiency and data retrieval. That early experience gave me a strong foundation in Java, Spring, XML, and enterprise systems.

From there, I moved into roles with Innominds, IBM, and Dell Technologies, where I grew into senior and architect-level roles. At Dell, as an Application Architect, I led the migration of monolithic applications to microservices using Spring Boot and REST APIs, deployed on cloud platforms like Kubernetes and GCP. I also focused heavily on frontend development using Angular, leading end-to-end projects that improved usability, performance, and scalability.

My role at Biogen as a Lead Full Stack Developer was especially impactful. I led the development of real-time supply chain dashboards and microservices for drug tracking and compliance. We ensured HIPAA and FDA compliance, used AWS cloud services, and built integrations with ERP and logistics platforms. That experience helped me refine my skills in secure REST API design, OAuth 2.0, and cloud-native infrastructure.

Currently, I‚Äôm working at Amazon Robotics as a Senior Full Stack Developer, where I architect and build systems for robot manufacturing and warehouse delivery. My work spans across Spring Boot microservices, Angular dashboards, Kafka for real-time data streaming, and GCP/AWS cloud platforms. We've seen significant business impact‚Äîsuch as a 40% improvement in system scalability, 99.9% uptime, and a 30% reduction in delivery response times. I also lead initiatives around CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and CodePipeline, monitoring with CloudWatch and Prometheus, and testing using JUnit, Mockito, and Postman.

Throughout my career, I‚Äôve consistently contributed to both frontend and backend development, making me a true full-stack engineer. I‚Äôm passionate about writing clean, testable code, following Agile Scrum methodologies, mentoring junior developers, and keeping up with the latest trends in microservices, DevOps, and cloud-native development.

On the technical side, I‚Äôm skilled in Java (up to Java 17), Spring ecosystem, Angular 15, Kafka, Redis, MongoDB, Oracle, and cloud services across AWS and GCP. I also hold certifications including AWS Solutions Architect Associate, Oracle Certified Java Programmer, and Agile Scrum Master.

I‚Äôm looking for a role where I can contribute to architecture and development, lead end-to-end solutions, and help scale enterprise systems with modern full-stack and cloud technologies.

Thank you for the opportunity, and I‚Äôm excited to learn more about this role and how I can contribute to your team.

Expanded Explanation:
Designing and delivering scalable, cloud-native, and high-performance applications

Throughout my career, I‚Äôve been focused on building enterprise-grade systems that are scalable, resilient, and ready for the cloud from day one. Here's what that typically involves:

üß± 1. Scalable Architecture Design
Scalability starts at the design phase. I use microservices architecture extensively, where each service is independently deployable, versioned, and scaled based on demand.

For example, at Amazon Robotics, I broke down the robot management system into microservices like:

Robot Manufacturing

Delivery Tracking

Warehouse Inventory

This allowed us to independently scale components like delivery tracking during peak periods, reducing infrastructure costs by over 30%.

I also follow domain-driven design (DDD) principles to ensure services align with business capabilities.

‚òÅÔ∏è 2. Cloud-Native Delivery
I design systems to be cloud-first using services like:

AWS (EC2, Lambda, ECS, S3, RDS)

GCP (Cloud Run, GKE, Pub/Sub, Firestore)

Instead of lifting and shifting, I build apps to natively utilize cloud features:

Auto-scaling using Kubernetes and ECS

Serverless compute with AWS Lambda for real-time triggers

Event-driven design using Kafka or Pub/Sub for decoupled communication

At Biogen, for example, I built supply chain APIs hosted on AWS, connected via secure OAuth2-based gateways, and stored data in RDS and S3, while auto-scaling with CloudWatch triggers.

‚ö° 3. High-Performance Engineering
Performance optimization is integral to my process:

Caching: I use Redis or in-memory caching to reduce latency for frequently accessed data.

Asynchronous Communication: For heavy processing tasks, I implement Kafka to queue and stream events asynchronously across services.

Database Optimization: I use indexing, query tuning, and schema refactoring. At Dell, this improved query response times by over 50%.

Additionally, I perform:

Load & stress testing using JMeter or custom scripts

Profiling of slow services to eliminate bottlenecks

Monitoring and alerting via CloudWatch, Prometheus, and Kibana to proactively tune performance

At Amazon Robotics, this approach reduced average service response times by 25% and helped achieve 99.9% uptime SLA across modules.

üîÑ 4. CI/CD and DevOps Enablement
To deliver these systems reliably and frequently, I use:

CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins, GitLab CI, and AWS CodePipeline

Docker + Kubernetes for containerized deployments

IaC tools like Terraform or CloudFormation (as needed)

This ensures applications are reproducible, version-controlled, and deployable across multiple environments.

üîí 5. Secure by Design
Performance is never at the cost of security. I embed:

JWT/OAuth2 for secure authentication/authorization

TLS/SSL encryption, input validation, and audit logging

Compliance enforcement (HIPAA, GDPR, FDA in Biogen projects)

‚úÖ Summary:
So when I say ‚Äúdesigning and delivering scalable, cloud-native, and high-performance applications‚Äù, I mean building robust systems that:

Are modular and independently scalable

Leverage cloud-native tools and services

Optimize for speed, throughput, and reliability

Are resilient under load

And are secure, compliant, and DevOps-enabled
