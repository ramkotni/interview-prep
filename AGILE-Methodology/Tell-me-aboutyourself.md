Hi, my name is Ram Mohan Kotni, and I bring over 16 years of experience as a Java Full Stack Developer with deep expertise in designing and delivering scalable, cloud-native, and high-performance applications across diverse industries like e-commerce, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, robotics, and finance.

I began my career in 2007 as a Java Developer at Wells Fargo, where I worked on Spring-based financial applications, improving payment processing efficiency and data retrieval. That early experience gave me a strong foundation in Java, Spring, XML, and enterprise systems.

From there, I moved into roles with Innominds, IBM, and Dell Technologies, where I grew into senior and architect-level roles. At Dell, as an Application Architect, I led the migration of monolithic applications to microservices using Spring Boot and REST APIs, deployed on cloud platforms like Kubernetes and GCP. I also focused heavily on frontend development using Angular, leading end-to-end projects that improved usability, performance, and scalability.

My role at Biogen as a Lead Full Stack Developer was especially impactful. I led the development of real-time supply chain dashboards and microservices for drug tracking and compliance. We ensured HIPAA and FDA compliance, used AWS cloud services, and built integrations with ERP and logistics platforms. That experience helped me refine my skills in secure REST API design, OAuth 2.0, and cloud-native infrastructure.

Currently, I’m working at Amazon Robotics as a Senior Full Stack Developer, where I architect and build systems for robot manufacturing and warehouse delivery. My work spans across Spring Boot microservices, Angular dashboards, Kafka for real-time data streaming, and GCP/AWS cloud platforms. We've seen significant business impact—such as a 40% improvement in system scalability, 99.9% uptime, and a 30% reduction in delivery response times. I also lead initiatives around CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and CodePipeline, monitoring with CloudWatch and Prometheus, and testing using JUnit, Mockito, and Postman.

Throughout my career, I’ve consistently contributed to both frontend and backend development, making me a true full-stack engineer. I’m passionate about writing clean, testable code, following Agile Scrum methodologies, mentoring junior developers, and keeping up with the latest trends in microservices, DevOps, and cloud-native development.

On the technical side, I’m skilled in Java (up to Java 17), Spring ecosystem, Angular 15, Kafka, Redis, MongoDB, Oracle, and cloud services across AWS and GCP. I also hold certifications including AWS Solutions Architect Associate, Oracle Certified Java Programmer, and Agile Scrum Master.

I’m looking for a role where I can contribute to architecture and development, lead end-to-end solutions, and help scale enterprise systems with modern full-stack and cloud technologies.

Thank you for the opportunity, and I’m excited to learn more about this role and how I can contribute to your team.

Tips:
Practice delivering this in a conversational tone, not reading.

Pause briefly after major career transitions.

Be ready to deep-dive into any of the companies or projects when asked follow-ups.
