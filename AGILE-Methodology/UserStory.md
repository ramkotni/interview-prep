💡 User Story Examples (Domain-Specific)
⚡ Electricity (ERCOT Use Case)
Real-Time Grid Alert

As a Qualified Scheduling Entity (QSE), I want to receive real-time alerts when grid frequency drops below threshold so that I can take corrective action immediately.

Load Forecast Dashboard

As an ERCOT operator, I want a dashboard that shows 7-day load forecasts so that I can better manage generation scheduling.

Automated Email Notification

As a market participant, I want to receive daily emails with system status summaries so that I stay informed even when I’m not logged in.

🧪 Include Acceptance Criteria (BDD format)
Using Gherkin-style:


Given I am logged in as a QSE
When the system frequency drops below 59.91 Hz
Then I should receive a real-time alert via SMS and email
🛠️ Tips to Write Good Stories
