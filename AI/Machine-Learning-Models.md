Features of Machine Learning
Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
It is similar to data mining, as both deal with substantial amounts of data.
For large organizations, branding is crucial, and targeting a relatable customer base becomes easier.
Given a dataset, ML can detect various patterns in the data.
Machines can learn from past data and automatically improve their performance.
Machine learning is a data-driven technology. A large amount of data is generated by organizations daily, enabling them to identify notable relationships and make better decisions.


FAQs on Machine Learning Tutorial
How ML it different from Deep learning ?
Machine learning develop programs that can access data and learn from it. Deep learning is the sub domain of the machine learning. Deep learning supports automatic extraction of features from the raw data.

What are the next steps after learning machine learning?
Explore advanced topics like deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision.
