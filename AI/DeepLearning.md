Control systems: Deep reinforcement learning models can be used to control complex systems such as power grids, traffic management, and supply chain optimization. 
Challenges in Deep Learning
Deep learning has made significant advancements in various fields, but there are still some challenges that need to be addressed. Here are some of the main challenges in deep learning:

Data availability: It requires large amounts of data to learn from. For using deep learning it’s a big concern to gather as much data for training.
Computational Resources: For training the deep learning model, it is computationally expensive because it requires specialized hardware like GPUs and TPUs.
Time-consuming: While working on sequential data depending on the computational resource it can take very large even in days or months. 
Interpretability: Deep learning models are complex, it works like a black box. it is very difficult to interpret the result.
Overfitting: when the model is trained again and again, it becomes too specialized for the training data, leading to overfitting and poor performance on new data.
Advantages of Deep Learning:
High accuracy: Deep Learning algorithms can achieve state-of-the-art performance in various tasks, such as image recognition and natural language processing.
Automated feature engineering: Deep Learning algorithms can automatically discover and learn relevant features from data without the need for manual feature engineering.
Scalability: Deep Learning models can scale to handle large and complex datasets, and can learn from massive amounts of data.
Flexibility: Deep Learning models can be applied to a wide range of tasks and can handle various types of data, such as images, text, and speech.
Continual improvement: Deep Learning models can continually improve their performance as more data becomes available.
Disadvantages of Deep Learning:
High computational requirements: Deep Learning AI models require large amounts of data and computational resources to train and optimize.
Requires large amounts of labeled data: Deep Learning models often require a large amount of labeled data for training, which can be expensive and time- consuming to acquire.
Interpretability: Deep Learning models can be challenging to interpret, making it difficult to understand how they make decisions.
Overfitting: Deep Learning models can sometimes overfit to the training data, resulting in poor performance on new and unseen data.
Black-box nature: Deep Learning models are often treated as black boxes, making it difficult to understand how they work and how they arrived at their predictions.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the field of Deep Learning represents a transformative leap in artificial intelligence.
